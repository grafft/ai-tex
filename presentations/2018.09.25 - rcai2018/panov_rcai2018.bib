A number of model experiments with well-known motion dataset of Carnegie Mellon University have been carried out. An extended version of HTM is proposed, in which feedback on the movement of the sensor's focus on the video frame is added, as well as intermediate processing of the signal transmitted from the lower layers of the hierarchy to the upper ones. By using elements of reinforcement learning and feedback on focus movement, the HTM's temporal pooler includes information about the next position of focus, simulating the human saccadic movements. Processing the output of the temporal memory stabilizes the recognition process in large hierarchies.},

Although modern robotic systems have become safe and reliable enough to operate close to human workers on a day-to-day basis, the workload is still skewed in favor of a limited contribution from the robot's side, and a significant cognitive load is allotted to the human. We believe the transition from robots as recipients of human instruction to robots as capable collaborators hinges around the implementation of transparent systems, where mental models about the task are shared between peers, and the human partner is freed from the responsibility of taking care of both actors. In this work, we implement a transparent task planner able to be deployed in realistic, near-future applications. The proposed framework is capable of basic reasoning capabilities for what concerns role assignment and task allocation, and it interfaces with the human partner at the level of abstraction he is most comfortable with. The system is readily available to non-expert users, and programmable with high-level commands in an intuitive interface. Our results demonstrate an overall improvement in terms of completion time, as well as a reduced cognitive load for the human partner.},

@article{Barsalou1999,
	abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

@article{Oizumi2014,
	abstract = {This paper presents Integrated Information Theory (IIT) of consciousness 3.0, which incorporates several advances over previous formulations. IIT starts from phenomenological axioms: information says that each experience is specific – it is what it is by how it differs from alternative experiences; integration says that it is unified – irreducible to non- interdependent components; exclusion says that it has unique borders and a particular spatio-temporal grain. These axioms are formalized into postulates that prescribe how physical mechanisms, such as neurons or logic gates, must be configured to generate experience (phenomenology). The postulates are used to define intrinsic information as ‘‘differences that make a difference'' within a system, and integrated information as information specified by a whole that cannot be reduced to that specified by its parts. By applying the postulates both at the level of individual mechanisms and at the level of systems of mechanisms, IIT arrives at an identity: an experience is a maximally irreducible conceptual structure (MICS, a constellation of concepts in qualia space), and the set of elements that generates it constitutes a complex. According to IIT, a MICS specifies the quality of an experience and integrated information WMax its quantity. From the theory follow several results, including: a system of mechanisms may condense into a major complex and non-overlapping minor complexes; the concepts that specify the quality of an experience are always about the complex itself and relate only indirectly to the external environment; anatomical connectivity influences complexes and associated MICS; a complex can generate a MICS even if its elements are inactive; simple systems can be minimally conscious; complicated systems can be unconscious; there can be true ‘‘zombies'' – unconscious feed-forward systems that are functionally equivalent to conscious complexes.

@article{Baars2013,
	abstract = {A global workspace (GW) is a functional hub of binding and propagation in a population of loosely coupled signaling elements. In computational applications, GW architectures recruit many distributed, specialized agents to cooperate in resolving focal ambiguities. In the brain, conscious experiences may reflect a GW function. For animals, the natural world is full of unpredictable dangers and opportunities, suggesting a general adaptive pressure for brains to resolve focal ambiguities quickly and accurately. GW theory aims to understand the differences between conscious and unconscious brain events. In humans and related species the cortico-thalamic (C-T) core is believed to underlie conscious aspects of perception, thinking, learning, feelings of knowing (FOK), felt emotions, visual imagery, working memory, and executive control. Alternative theoretical perspectives are also discussed. The C-T core has many anatomical hubs, but conscious percepts are unitary and internally consistent at any given moment. Over time, conscious contents constitute a very large, open set. This suggests that a brain-based GW capacity cannot be localized in a single anatomical hub. Rather, it should be sought in a functional hub - a dynamic capacity for binding and propagation of neural signals over multiple task-related networks, a kind of neuronal cloud computing. In this view, conscious contents can arise in any region of the C-T core when multiple input streams settle on a winner-take-all equilibrium. The resulting conscious gestalt may ignite an any-to-many broadcast, lasting ∼100-200 ms, and trigger widespread adaptation in previously established networks. To account for the great range of conscious contents over time, the theory suggests an open repertoire of binding coalitions that can broadcast via theta/gamma or alpha/gamma phase coupling, like radio channels competing for a narrow frequency band. Conscious moments are thought to hold only 1-4 unrelated items; this small focal capacity may be the biological price to pay for global access. Visuotopic maps in cortex specialize in features like color, retinal size, motion, object identity, and egocentric/allocentric framing, so that a binding coalition for the sight of a rolling billiard ball in nearby space may resonate among activity maps of LGN, V1-V4, MT, IT, as well as the dorsal stream. Spatiotopic activity maps can bind into coherent gestalts using adaptive resonance (reentry). Single neurons can join a dominant coalition by phase tuning to regional oscillations in the 4-12 Hz range. Sensory percepts may bind and broadcast from posterior cortex, while non-sensory FOKs may involve prefrontal and frontotemporal areas. The anatomy and physiology of the hippocampal complex suggest a GW architecture as well. In the intact brain the hippocampal complex may support conscious event organization as well as episodic memory storage.},

	abstract = {"Column," like "gene," has both conceptual and linguistic shortcomings. The simple question "what is a column" is not easy to answer and the word itself is not easy to replace. In the present article, I have selected five points, in no way comprehensive or canonical, but which may nevertheless serve as a prompt and aid for further discussions and re-evaluation. These are: that anatomical columns are not solid structures, that they are part of locally interdigitating systems, that any delimited column also participates in a widely distributed network, that columns are not an obligatory cortical feature, and that columns (as "modules") occur widely in the brain in non-cortical structures. I focus on the larger scale macrocolumns, mainly from an anatomical perspective. My position is that cortical organization is inherently dynamic and likely to incorporate multiple processing styles. One can speculate that the distributed mappings within areas like piriform cortex may resemble at least one mode of neocortical processing strategy.},

	abstract = {The theoretical setting of hierarchical Bayesian inference is gaining acceptance as a framework for understanding cortical computation. In this paper, we describe how Bayesian belief propagation in a spatio-temporal hierarchical model, called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM), can lead to a mathematical model for cortical circuits. An HTM node is abstracted using a coincidence detector and a mixture of Markov chains. Bayesian belief propagation equations for such an HTM node define a set of functional constraints for a neuronal implementation. Anatomical data provide a contrasting set of organizational constraints. The combination of these two constraints suggests a theoretically derived interpretation for many anatomical and physiological features and predicts several others. We describe the pattern recognition capabilities of HTM networks and demonstrate the application of the derived circuits for modeling the subjective contour effect. We also discuss how the theory and the circuit can be extended to explain cortical features that are not explained by the current model and describe testable predictions that can be derived from the model.},

Presently, a symbol paradigm of artificial intelligence offers a variety of planning algorithms, including those that use precedent information, i.e. algorithms based on acquired knowledge. A symbol grounding problem within the exiting approaches of knowledge representation does not allow effective use the developed algorithms together with learning mechanisms for the purpose of solving a wide variety of applied problems by actual intelligent agents (robotics systems). This article presents the original planning algorithm (MAP Planner), which uses a sign world model as the basis for acquisition and maintenance of knowledge for future use in behavior planning. the sign problem approach describes planning as a cognitive function actualized by the world model of a subject of activity. Apart from solving symbol grounding problems and ensuring psychological and biological plausibility, a sign planning process model allows interaction of an intelligent agent with other participants in solving a cooperative task. The article presents the description of the knowledge representation method used, a MAP planning algorithm, and a model experiment in a “block world”.},

The description is based on the concept of sign, which is widely used in psychology and, in particular, in the cultural-historical theory by Vygotsky, in which sign is interpreted informally. In this paper, we elaborate upon the concept of sign, consider mechanisms of sign formation, and some self-organization on the set of signs. Due to the work of self-organization mechanisms, a new method for the representation of the world model of an actor appears. The concept of semiotic network is introduced that is used for the examination of the actor's world models. Models of some functions indicated above are constructed. The second part of the paper is devoted to functions of self-consciousness and to the application of the constructed models for designing plans and constructing new architectures of intelligent agents that are able, in particular, to distribute roles in coalitions.},

At the same time most of the widespread planning algorithms employed in those systems are developed using only approaches and models of Artificial Intelligence and don't take into account numerous results of cognitive experiments. As a result, there is a strong need for novel methods of behavior planning suitable for modern cognitive architectures aimed at robot control. One such method is presented in this work and is studied within a special class of navigation task called smart relocation task. The method is based on the hierarchical two-level model of abstraction and knowledge representation, e.g. symbolic and subsymbolic. On the symbolic level sign world model is used for knowledge representation and hierarchical planning algorithm, MAP, is utilized for planning. On the subsymbolic level the task of path planning is considered and solved as a graph search problem. Interaction between both planners is examined and inter-level interfaces and feedback loops are described. Preliminary experimental results are presented.},

The paper presents an original method for roles distribution - the MultiMAP algorithm, based on the sign-based method of agent's behavior planning. The main features of the described approach are presented, including ways of representing the agent's knowledge of himself and other agents, methods of sign communication and preserving the experience of cooperation with other agents. Model experiments are described that demonstrate the main advantages of the approach presented and some of the shortcomings to be eliminated in future work.},

Our focus is on modeling an actor{\{}$\backslash$textquoteright{\}}s decision making when they encounter notable events. We model GR as an iterative refinement process, where constraints introduced for each abstraction layer shape the solutions for successive layers. Our model provides a conceptual framework for robotics researchers and practitioners. We present a goal lifecycle and define a formal model for GR that (1) relates distinct disciplines concerning actors that operate on goals, and (2) provides a way to evaluate actors. We introduce GR using an example on waypoint navigation and outline its application, in three projects, for controlling simulated and real-world vehicles. We emphasize the relation of GR to planning, and encourage PlanRob researchers to collaborate in exploring this exciting frontier.},

	abstract = {A key capability that distinguishes humans from intelligent agents is the ability to generate and select new goals in an unexpected situation, while re-prioritizing existing goals. This level of cognitive autonomy becomes practically vital for actors working as team members with humans or in unpredictable environments. The work is focused on a new perspective on this problem based on biologically inspired cognitive architectures (BICA). Aspects of goal reasoning and goal management capabilities that are currently available in selected BICA are reviewed. A generalizing model of goal reasoning as a form of metacognition is defined, that integrates multiple mechanisms. On top of the traditional cognitive cycle, the model includes a goal-reasoning cycle triggered by notable phenomena. This goal reasoning cycle integrates mechanisms like agitation of desires by drives and their instantiation in goals, or metacognitive reasoning about goals. The model is illustrated by consideration of specific scenarios at micro- and macro-cognitive scales to evaluate the use and potential capabilities of this goal reasoning model for BICA. New capabilities that will be enabled based on this approach are expected to increase the human compatibility and cognitive autonomy of future intelligent agents. The general goal reasoning capability is a key component included in the BICA Challenge and is required for integration of intelligent agents into human teams.},

Our method is based on the Hierarchy Of Abstract Machines (HAM) framework because HAM approach is able to design efficient controllers that will realize specific behaviors in real robots. The key to our algorithm is the introduction of the internal or "mental" environment in which the state represents the structure of the HAM hierarchy. The internal action in this environment leads to changes the hierarchy of HAMs. We propose the classical Q-learning procedure in the internal environment which allows the agent to obtain an optimal hierarchy. We extends the HAM framework by adding on-model approach to select the appropriate sub-machine to execute action sequences for certain class of external environment states. Preliminary experiments demonstrated the prospects of the method.},

These functions include reflection, consciousness of activity motivation, goal setting, synthesis of goal oriented behavior, and some others. The description is based on the concept of sign, which is widely used in psychology and, in particular, in the cultural-historical theory by Vygotsky, in which sign is interpreted informally. In this paper, we elaborate upon the concept of sign, consider mechanisms of sign formation, and some self-organization on the set of signs. Due to the work of self-organization mechanisms, a new method for the representation of the world model of an actor appears. The concept of semiotic network is introduced that is used for the examination of the actor's world models. Models of some functions indicated above are constructed. The second part of the paper is devoted to functions of self-consciousness and to the application of the constructed models for designing plans and constructing new architectures of intelligent agents that are able, in particular, to distribute roles in coalitions.},

Autonomous learning is critical in the development of cognitive agents, and several learning-related desiderata useful for 'psychological' cognitive architectures are proposed. This article shows that all the reviewed cognitive architectures include some form of explicit ('symbolic') and implicit ('subsymbolic') learning. Additionally, ACT-R and Clarion are shown to include a top-down learning algorithm (from explicit to implicit), and Clarion also includes a bottom-up learning process (from implicit to explicit). Two simulation examples are presented with each cognitive architecture to illustrate the autonomous learning capacities of each modeling paradigm. While Clarion is more autonomous (requiring less a priori knowledge), Soar and ACT-R have so far been used in more complex tasks. The presentation concludes with some general considerations for future work. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},
