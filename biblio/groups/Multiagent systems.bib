@article{Jennings1995,
abstract = {One reason why Distributed AI (DAI) technology has been deployed in relatively few real-size applications is that it lacks a clear and implementable model of cooperative problem solving which specifies how agents should operate and interact in complex, dynamic and unpredictable environments. As a consequence of the experience gained whilst building a number of DAI systems for industrial applications, a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model, called Joint Responsibility, has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifies pre-conditions which must be attained before collaboration can commence and prescribes how individuals should behave both when joint activity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs into difficulty. The theoretical model has been used to guide the implementation of a general-purpose cooperation framework and the qualitative and quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessed through a series of comparative experiments in the real-world domain of electricity transportation management. Finally, the success of the approach of building a system with an explicit and grounded representation of cooperative problem solving is used to outline a proposal for the next generation of multi-agent systems.},

abstract = {Collaboration between humans and robots requires solutions to an array of challenging problems, including multi-agent planning, state estimation, and goal inference. There already exist feasible solutions for many of these challenges, but they depend upon having rich task models. In this work we detail a novel type of Hierarchical Task Network we call a Clique/Chain HTN (CC-HTN), alongside an algorithm for autonomously constructing them from topological properties derived from graphical task representations. As the presented method relies on the structure of the task itself, our work imposes no particular type of symbolic insight into motor primitives or environmental representation, making it applicable to a wide variety of use cases critical to human-robot interaction. We present evaluations within a multi-resolution goal inference task and a transfer learning application showing the utility of our approach.},

abstract = {When robots work alongside humans for performing collaborative tasks, they need to be able to anticipate human's future actions and plan appropriate actions. The tasks we consider are performed in contextually-rich environments containing objects, and there is a large variation in the way humans perform these tasks. We use a graphical model to represent the state-space, where we model the humans through their low-level kinematics as well as their high-level intent, and model their interactions with the objects through physically-grounded object affordances. This allows our model to anticipate a belief about possible future human actions, and we model the human's and robot's behavior through an MDP in this rich state- space. We further discuss that due to perception errors and the limitations of the model, the human may not take the optimal action and therefore we present robot's anticipatory planning with different behaviors of thehumanwithin themodel's scope. In experiments onCornellActivity Dataset, we showthat our method performs better than various baselines for collaborative planning.},

These high-level abilities depend on reliable navigation and perception of the environment. We present cognitively plausible agents used for training in virtual simulations of Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT). These cognitive agents are developed using the ACT-R cognitive architecture, an architecture used to model human performance in a wide variety of psychological experiments. These agents use their real-time perceptions to shape their interactions with other agents and human players on both the friendly and opposing sides of the conflict. Planning is accomplished on-line by combining schematic plans with the current context, resulting in flexible and appropriate action. Roles within plans are negotiated between agents on an as-needed basis while plans are selected based on the availability of other agents. 1},

@article{Maliah2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s)In many cases several entities, such as commercial companies, need to work together towards the achievement of joint goals, while hiding certain private information. To collaborate effectively, some sort of plan is needed to coordinate the different entities. We address the problem of automatically generating such a coordination plan while preserving the agents' privacy. Maintaining privacy is challenging when planning for multiple agents, especially when tight collaboration is needed and a global high-level view of the plan is required. In this work we present the Greedy Privacy-Preserving Planner (GPPP), a privacy preserving planning algorithm in which the agents collaboratively generate an abstract and approximate global coordination plan and then individually extend the global plan to executable plans. To guide GPPP, we propose two domain independent privacy preserving heuristics based on landmarks and pattern databases, which are classical heuristics for single agent search. These heuristics, called privacy-preserving landmarks and privacy preserving PDBs, are agnostic to the planning algorithm and can be used by other privacy-preserving planning algorithms. Empirically, we demonstrate on benchmark domains the benefits of using these heuristics and the advantage of GPPP over existing privacy preserving planners for the multi-agent STRIPS formalism.},

In multi-agent systems, agents may form teams by sharing common goals with other agents. Cooperation is essential for any collaborative, group activity. Beyond coordination and judicious role assignment, cooperation enables members of a team to be aware and account for collection of their goals as well as the performance of agents on individual goals. This paper presents a general model of cooperation and illustrates how it may enhance group performance. In this paper, we present results of an application of the concept of cooperation in a simulated swarm of reconnaissance urban UAVs that are tracking vehicles in an urban environment.},

A number of recent planning algo- rithms enable agents to plan together for shared goals without disclosing information about their private state and actions. But these algorithms lack clear and formal privacy guarantees: the fact that they do not require agents to explicitly reveal pri- vate information, does not imply that such informa- tion cannot be deduced. The main contribution of this paper is an enhanced version of the distributed forward-search planning framework of Nissim and Brafman that reveals less information than the orig- inal algorithm, and the first, to our knowledge, dis- cussion and formal proof of privacy guarantees for distributed planning and search algorithms.},

abstract = {As we progress towards a world where robots play an integral role in society, a critical problem that remains to be solved is the pickup team challenge; that is, dynamically formed heterogeneous robot teams executing coordinated tasks where little information is known a priori about the tasks, the robots, and the environments in which they would operate. Successful solutions to forming pickup teams would enable researchers to experiment with larger numbers of robots and enable industry to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate new robot technology with existing legacy teams. In this paper, we define the challenge of pickup teams and propose the treasure hunt domain for evaluating the performance of pickup teams. Additionally, we describe a basic implementation of a pickup team that can search and discover treasure in a previously unknown environment. We build on prior approaches in market-based task allocation and plays for synchronized task execution, to allocate roles amongst robots in the pickup team, and to execute synchronized team actions to accomplish the treasure hunt task},

abstract = {We present a framework for learning human user models from joint-action demonstrations that enables the robot to compute a robust policy for a collaborative task with a human. The learning takes place completely automatically, without any human intervention. First, we describe the clustering of demonstrated action sequences into different human types using an unsupervised learning algorithm. These demonstrated sequences are also used by the robot to learn a reward function that is representative for each type, through the employment of an inverse reinforcement learning algorithm. The learned model is then used as part of a Mixed Observability Markov Decision Process formulation, wherein the human type is a partially observable variable. With this framework, we can infer, either offline or online, the human type of a new user that was not included in the training set, and can compute a policy for the robot that will be aligned to the preference of this new user and will be robust to deviations of the human actions from prior demonstrations. Finally we validate the approach using data collected in human subject experiments, and conduct proof-of-concept demonstrations in which a person performs a collaborative task with a small industrial robot.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning algorithms can train agents that solve problems in complex, interesting environments. Normally, the complexity of the trained agent is closely related to the complexity of the environment. This suggests that a highly capable agent requires a complex environment for training. In this paper, we point out that a competitive multi-agent environment trained with self-play can produce behaviors that are far more complex than the environment itself. We also point out that such environments come with a natural curriculum, because for any skill level, an environment full of agents of this level will have the right level of difficulty. This work introduces several competitive multi-agent environments where agents compete in a 3D world with simulated physics. The trained agents learn a wide variety of complex and interesting skills, even though the environment themselves are relatively simple. The skills include behaviors such as running, blocking, ducking, tackling, fooling opponents, kicking, and defending using both arms and legs. A highlight of the learned behaviors can be found here: https://goo.gl/eR7fbX},

@article{Gal2010,
abstract = {Computer systems increasingly carry out tasks in mixed networks, that is in group settings in which they interact both with other computer systems and with people. Participants in these heterogeneous human-computer groups vary in their capabilities, goals, and strategies; they may cooperate, collaborate, or compete. The presence of people in mixed networks raises challenges for the design and the evaluation of decision-making strategies for computer agents. This paper describes several new decision-making models that represent, learn and adapt to various social attributes that influence people's decision-making and presents a novel approach to evaluating such models. It identifies a range of social attributes in an open-network setting that influence people's decision-making and thus affect the performance of computer-agent strategies, and establishes the importance of learning and adaptation to the success of such strategies. The settings vary in the capabilities, goals, and strategies that people bring into their interactions. The studies deploy a configurable system called Colored Trails (CT) that generates a family of games. CT is an abstract, conceptually simple but highly versatile game in which players negotiate and exchange resources to enable them to achieve their individual or group goals. It provides a realistic analogue to multi-agent task domains, while not requiring extensive domain modeling. It is less abstract than payoff matrices, and people exhibit less strategic and more helpful behavior in CT than in the identical payoff matrix decision-making context. By not requiring extensive domain modeling, CT enables agent researchers to focus their attention on strategy design, and it provides an environment in which the influence of social factors can be better isolated and studied. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach to multiagent planning in domains with concurrent actions and associated concurrent action constraints. In these domains, we associate the actions of individual agents with subsets of objects, which allows for a transformation of the problems into single-agent planning problems that are considerably easier to solve. The transformation forces agents to select joint actions associated with a single subset of objects at a time, and ensures that the concurrency constraints on this subset are satisfied. Joint actions are serialised such that each agent performs their part of the action separately. The number of actions in the resulting single-agent planning problem turns out to be manageable in many real-world domains, thus allowing the problem to be solved efficiently using a standard single-agent planner. We also describe a cost-optimal algorithm for compressing the resulting plan, i.e. merging individual actions in order to reduce the total number of joint actions. Results show that our approach can handle large problems that are impossible to solve for most multiagent planners.},
