abstract = {We start by assuming that the self is implemented in the brain as a functional unit, with a definite set of properties. We deduce the fundamental properties of the self from an analysis of neurological disorders and from introspection. We formulate a functionalist concept of the self based on these properties reduced to constraints. We use the formalism of schemas in our functionalist analysis, i.e. a symbolic level description of brain dynamics. We then reformulate the functionalist model at a connectionist level and address the emergent "context shifting" problem. We suggest how the model might be mapped onto the functional neuroanatomy of the brain, and how it could be used to give an account of a range of neurological disorders, including hippocampal amnesia, various forms of schizophrenia, multiple personality, autism, PTSD, hemineglect, and reversible anosognosia. Finally, we briefly discuss future perspectives and possible applications of computer implementations of the model.},

@article{Caro2015,
abstract = {Metacognition has been used in artificial intelligence to increase the level of autonomy of intelligent systems. However the design of systems with metacognitive capabilities is a difficult task due to the number and complexity of processes involved. This paper presents a domain-specific visual language specifically developed for modeling metacognition in intelligent systems called M++. In M++ the specifications of the cognitive level (object-level) and metacognitive level (meta-level) are supported in a metamodel configured according to the standard Meta-Object Facility (MOF) of Model-Driven Architecture (MDA) methodology. M++ allows the generation of metacognitive diagrams in a visual editor named MetaThink. A validation process was conducted to ensure the reliability of M++ in terms of quality of the notation and consistency of generated models. The validation was performed using two techniques: (i) empirical study and (ii) model tracing. The results given in the experimental study demonstrate that M++ is a useful notation for the process of modeling metacognitive components in intelligent systems. Metacognitive models generated from the validation process using the Tracing technique were consistent with the MOF-based metamodel. M++ contribute to cognitive architecture research adding precision to metacognitive concepts and enabling cognitive architecture researchers to do fast and exploratory prototyping of metacognitive systems using MetaThink tool.},

@article{Blanke2015,
abstract = {Recent work in human cognitive neuroscience has linked self-consciousness to the processing of multisen- sory bodily signals (bodily self-consciousness [BSC]) in fronto-parietal cortex and more posterior temporo- parietal regions.Wehighlight the behavioral, neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and computational laws that subtend BSCin humans and non-human primates.Wepropose thatBSCincludes body-centered perception (hand, face, and trunk), based on the integration of proprioceptive, vestibular, and visual bodily inputs, and involves spatio-temporal mechanisms integrating multisensory bodily stimuli within peripersonal space (PPS). We develop four major constraints of BSC (proprioception, body-related visual information, PPS, and embodiment) and argue that the fronto-parietal and temporo-parietal processing of trunk-centered multisensory signals in PPS is of particular relevance for theoretical models and simulations of BSC and eventually of self-consciousness.},

@book{Cox2011,
abstract = {The capacity to think about our own thinking may lie at the heart of what it means to be both human and intelligent. Philosophers and cognitive scientists have investigated these matters for many years. Researchers in artificial intelligence have gone further, attempting to implement actual machines that mimic, simulate, and perhaps even replicate this capacity, called metareasoning. In this volume, leading authorities offer a variety of perspectives--drawn from philosophy, cognitive psychology, and computer science--on reasoning about the reasoning process. The book offers a simple model of reasoning about reason as a framework for its discussions. Following this framework, the contributors consider metalevel control of computational activities, introspective monitoring, distributed metareasoning, and, putting all these aspects of metareasoning together, models of the self. Taken together, the chapters offer an integrated narrative on metareasoning themes from both artificial intelligence and cognitive science perspectives.},
