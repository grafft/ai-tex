abstract = {Mobile robots and animals alike must effectively navigate their environments in order to achieve their goals. For animals goal-directed navigation facilitates finding food, seeking shelter or migration; similarly robots perform goal-directed navigation to find a charging station, get out of the rain or guide a person to a destination. This similarity in tasks extends to the environment as well; increasingly, mobile robots are operating in the same underwater, ground and aerial environments that animals do. Yet despite these similarities, goal-directed navigation research in robotics and biology has proceeded largely in parallel, linked only by a small amount of interdisciplinary research spanning both areas. Most state-of-the-art robotic navigation systems employ a range of sensors, world representations and navigation algorithms that seem far removed from what we know of how animals navigate; their navigation systems are shaped by key principles of navigation in 'real-world' environments including dealing with uncertainty in sensing, landmark observation and world modelling. By contrast, biomimetic animal navigation models produce plausible animal navigation behaviour in a range of laboratory experimental navigation paradigms, typically without addressing many of these robotic navigation principles. In this paper, we attempt to link robotics and biology by reviewing the current state of the art in conventional and biomimetic goal-directed navigation models, focusing on the key principles of goal-oriented robotic navigation and the extent to which these principles have been adapted by biomimetic navigation models and why.},

abstract = {This paper describes how a cognitive architecture builds a spatial model and navigates from it without a map. Each con- structed model is a collage of spatial affordances that de- scribes how the environment has been sensed and traversed. The system exploits the evolving model while it directs an agent to explore the environment. Effective models are learned quickly during travel. Moreover, when combined with simple heuristics, the learned spatial model supports effective navigation. In three simple environments, these learned mod- els describe space in ways familiar to people, and often pro- duce near-optimal travel times.},

Gist is computed here as a holistic statistical signature$\backslash$nof the image, yielding abstract scene classification and layout.$\backslash$nSaliency is computed as a measure of interest at every image location,$\backslash$nefficiently directing the time-consuming landmark identification$\backslash$nprocess towards the most likely candidate locations in the image.$\backslash$nThe gist and salient landmark features are then further processed$\backslash$nusing a Monte-Carlo localization algorithm to allow the robot to$\backslash$ngenerate its position.

@article{Epstein2015,
abstract = {Background: Optimal navigation for a simulated robot relies on a detailed map and explicit path planning. This is problematic for realworld robots, whose sensors and actuators are subject to noise and error, and whose environment may be dynamic. This paper reports on robots that rely on local spatial perception, learning, and commonsense rationales instead. Aims: Our thesis is that spatial abstractions learned from local sensing can support effective, autonomous robot navigation. Method: The simulated robot experiences real-world actuator error while it navigates autonomously. The robot's decision-making cognitive architecture relies on reactive and heuristic procedures based on simple rationales and spatial abstractions of where it has been. As the robot travels, it learns (and shares) affordances that facilitate movement, including perceived unobstructed areas and trail markers. Together they represent the environment but do not constitute a map. Robots navigate to five sets of targets in each of three environments. Results: This approach quickly produces efficient travel without planning or a map. Metrics include travel time, decision time, and distance. Experiments examine the impact of each kind of affordance. Comparison with a traditional A∗ planner shows that performance becomes only slightly suboptimal for one robot. Preliminary data with multiple robots suggest that, because our approach does need to replan when actuators err or robots threaten to collide, it will outperform the traditional approach. Conclusions: People have been shown not to navigate from detailed mental maps. Robots can also learn to navigate well without them, when they learn from local percepts.},

@article{Erdem2014,
abstract = {We propose an extended version of our previous goal directed navigation model based on forward planning of trajectories in a network of head direction cells, persistent spiking cells, grid cells, and place cells. In our original work the animat incrementally creates a place cell map by random exploration of a novel environment. After the exploration phase, the animat decides on its next movement direction towards a goal by probing linear look-ahead trajectories in several candidate directions while stationary and picking the one activating place cells representing the goal location. In this work we present several improvements over our previous model. We improve the range of linear look-ahead probes significantly by imposing a hierarchical structure on the place cell map consistent with the experimental findings of differences in the firing field size and spacing of grid cells recorded at different positions along the dorsal to ventral axis of entorhinal cortex. The new model represents the environment at different scales by populations of simulated hippocampal place cells with different firing field sizes. Among other advantages this model allows simultaneous constant duration linear look-ahead probes at different scales while significantly extending each probe range. The extension of the linear look-ahead probe range while keeping its duration constant also limits the degrading effects of noise accumulation in the network. We show the extended model's performance using an animat in a large open field environment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Computational cognitive models of spatial memory often neglect difficulties posed by the real world, such as sensory noise, uncertainty, and high spatial complexity. On the other hand, robotics is unconcerned with understanding biological cognition. Here, we describe a computational framework for robotic architectures aiming to function in realistic environments, as well as to be cognitively plausible. We motivate and describe several mechanisms towards achieving this despite the sensory noise and spatial complexity inherent in the physical world. We tackle error accumulation during path integration by means of Bayesian localization, and loop closing with sequential gradient descent. Finally, we outline a method for structuring spatial representations using metric learning and clustering. Crucially, unlike the algorithms of traditional robotics, we show that these mechanisms can be implemented in neuronal or cognitive models. We briefly outline a concrete implementation of the proposed framework as part of the LIDA cognitive architecture, and argue that this kind of probabilistic framework is well-suited for use in cognitive robotic architectures aiming to combine spatial functionality and psychological plausibility.},

@article{Milford2010,
abstract = {The challenge of persistent navigation and mapping is to develop an autonomous robot system that can simultaneously localize, map and navigate over the lifetime of the robot with little or no human intervention. Most solutions to the simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) problem aim to produce highly accurate maps of areas that are assumed to be static. In contrast, solutions for persistent navigation and mapping must produce reliable goal-directed navigation outcomes in an environment that is assumed to be in constant flux. We investigate the persistent navigation and mapping problem in the context of an autonomous robot that performs mock deliveries in a working office environment over a two-week period. The solution was based on the biologically inspired visual SLAM system, RatSLAM. RatSLAM performed SLAM continuously while interacting with global and local navigation systems, and a task selection module that selected between exploration, delivery, and recharging modes. The robot performed 1,143 delivery tasks to 11 different locations with only one delivery failure (from which it recovered), traveled a total distance of more than 40 km over 37 hours of active operation, and recharged autonomously a total of 23 times.},
