abstract = {LAMA is a classical planning system based on heuristic forward search. Its core feature is the use of a pseudo-heuristic derived from landmarks, propositional formulas that must be true in every solution of a planning task. LAMA builds on the Fast Downward planning system, using finite-domain rather than binary state variables and multi-heuristic search. The latter is employed to combine the landmark heuristic with a variant of the well-known FF heuristic. Both heuristics are cost-sensitive, focusing on high-quality solutions in the case where actions have non-uniform cost. A weighted A* search is used with iteratively decreasing weights, so that the planner continues to search for plans of better quality until the search is terminated. LAMA showed best performance among all planners in the sequential satisficing track of the International Planning Competition 2008. In this paper we present the system in detail and investigate which features of LAMA are crucial for its performance. We present individual results for some of the domains used at the competition, demonstrating good and bad cases for the techniques implemented in LAMA. Overall, we find that using landmarks improves performance, whereas the incorporation of action costs into the heuristic estimators proves not to be beneficial. We show that in some domains a search that ignores cost solves far more problems, raising the question of how to deal with action costs more effectively in the future. The iterated weighted A* search greatly improves results, and shows synergy effects with the use of landmarks.},

abstract = {In this paper we address planning problems in high-dimensional hybrid configuration spaces, with a particular focus on manipulation planning problems involving many objects. We present the hybrid backward-forward (HBF) planning algorithm that uses a backward identification of constraints to direct the sampling of the infinite action space in a forward search from the initial state towards a goal configuration. The resulting planner is probabilistically complete and can effectively construct long manipulation plans requiring both prehensile and nonprehensile actions in cluttered environments.},

abstract = {Fast Downward is a classical planning system based on heuristic search. It can deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the propositional fragment of PDDL2.2, including advanced features like ADL conditions and effects and derived predicates (axioms). Like other well-known planners such as HSP and FF, Fast Downward is a progression planner, searching the space of world states of a planning task in the forward direction. However, unlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast Downward does not use the propositional PDDL representation of a planning task directly. Instead, the input is first translated into an alternative representation called multivalued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints of a propositional planning task explicit. Exploiting this alternative representation, Fast Downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning tasks for computing its heuristic function, called the causal graph heuristic, which is very different from traditional HSP-like heuristics based on ignoring negative interactions of operators. In this article, we give a full account of Fast Downwards approach to solving multi-valued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal graph heuristic to tasks involving},

abstract = {Contemporary AI shows a healthy trend away from artificial problems towards real-world applications. Less healthy, however, is the fashionable disparagement of `toy' domains: when properly approached, these domains can at the very least support meaningful systematic experiments, and allow features relevant to many kinds of reasoning to be abstracted and studied. A major reason why they have fallen into disrepute is that superficial understanding of them has resulted in poor experimental methodology and consequent failure to extract useful information. This paper presents a sustained investigation of one such toy: the (in)famous Blocks World planning problem, and provides the level of understanding required for its effective use as a benchmark. Our results include methods for generating random problems for systematic experimentation, the best domain-specific planning algorithms against which AI planners can be compared, and observations establishing the average plan quality of near-optimal methods. We also study the distribution of hard/easy instances, and identify the structure that AI planners must be able to exploit in order to approach Blocks World successfully.},

abstract = {Domain-independent planning in general is broadly applicable to a wide range of tasks. Many formalisms exist that allow the description of different aspects of realistic problems. Which one to use is often no obvious choice, since a higher degree of expressiveness usually comes with an increased planning time and/or a decreased policy quality. Under the assumption that hard guarantees are not required, users are faced with a decision between multiple approaches. As a generic model we use a probabilistic description in the form of Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We define abstracting translations into a classical planning formalism and fully observable nondeterministic planning. Our goal is to give insight into how state-of-the-art systems perform on different MDP planning domains.},

We provide empirical evidence in favor of this approach, showing that Graphplan outperforms the total-order planner, Prodigy, and the partial-order planner, UCPOP, on a variety of interesting natural and artificial planning problems. We also give empirical evidence that the plans produced by Graphplan are quite sensible. Since searches made by this approach are fundamentally different from the searches of other common planning methods, they provide a new perspective on the planning problem.},

abstract = {Expertise consists of rapid selection and application of compiled experience. Robust reasoning, however, requires adaptation to new contingencies and intelligent modification of past experience. And novel or creative reasoning, by its real nature, necessitates general problem-solving abilities unconstrained by past behavior. This article presents a comprehensive computational model of analogical (case-based) reasoning that transitions smoothly between case replay, case adaptation, and general problem solving, exploiting and modifying past experience when available and resorting to general problem-solving methods when required. Learning occurs by accumulation of new cases, especially in situations that required extensive problem solving, and by tuning the indexing structure of the memory model to retrieve progressively more appropriate cases. The derivational replay mechanism is discussed in some detail, and extensive results of the first full implementation are presented. These results show up to a large performance improvement in a simple transportation domain for structurally similar problems, and smaller improvements when less strict similarity metrics are used for problems that share partial structure in a process-job planning domain and in an extended version of the strips robot domain.},

abstract = {Case-based reasoning depends on multiple knowledge sources beyond the case library, including knowledge about case adaptation and criteria for similarity assessment. Because hand coding this knowledge accounts for a large part of the knowledge acquisition burden for developing CBR systems, it is appealing to acquire it by learning, and CBR is a promising learning method to apply. This observation suggests developing case-based CBR systems, CBR systems whose components themselves use CBR. However, despite early interest in case-based approaches to CBR, this method has received comparatively little attention. Open questions include how case-based components of a CBR system should be designed, the amount of knowledge acquisition effort they require, and their effectiveness. This paper investigates these questions through a case study of issues addressed, methods used, and results achieved by a case-based planning system that uses CBR to guide its case adaptation and similarity assessment. The paper discusses design considerations and presents empirical results that support the usefulness of case-based CBR, that point to potential problems and tradeoffs, and that directly demonstrate the overlapping roles of different CBR knowledge sources. The paper closes with general lessons about case-based CBR and areas for future research.},

Simplicity is achieved by starting with a ground procedure and then applying a general, and independently verifiable, lifting transformation.

In Tate's procedure one is not required to determine whether a prerequisite of a step in an unfinished plan is guarateed to hold in all linearizations. This allows Tate's procedure to avoid the use of Chapman's modal truth criterion. Systematicity is the property that the same plan, or partial plan, is never examined more than once. Systematicity is achieved through a simple modification of Tate's procedure.},

abstract = {Point-based algorithms and RTDP-Bel are approximate methods for solving POMDPs that replace the full updates of parallel value iteration by faster and more effective updates at selected beliefs. An important difference between the two methods is that the former adopt Sondik's representation of the value function, while the latter uses a tabular representation and a discretization function. The algorithms, however, have not been compared up to now, because they target different POMDPs: discounted POMDPs on the one hand, and Goal POMDPs on the other. In this paper, we bridge this representational gap, showing how to transform discounted POMDPs into Goal POMDPs, and use the transformation to compare RTDP-Bel with point-based algorithms over the existing discounted benchmarks. The results appear to contradict the conventional wisdom in the area showing that RTDP-Bel is competitive, and sometimes superior to point-based algorithms in both quality and time. 1},

abstract = {This work proposes a novel high-level paradigm, agent planning programs, for modeling agents behavior, which suitably mixes automated planning with agent-oriented programming. Agent planning programs are finite-state programs, possibly containing loops, whose atomic instructions consist of a guard, a maintenance goal, and an achievement goal, which act as precondition-invariance-postcondition assertions in program specification. Such programs are to be executed in possibly nondeterministic planning domains and their execution requires generating plans that meet the goals specified in the atomic instructions, while respecting the program control flow. In this paper, we define the problem of automatically synthesizing the required plans to execute an agent planning program, propose a solution technique based on model checking of two-player game structures, and use it to characterize the worst-case computational complexity of the problem as EXPTIME-complete. Then, we consider the case of deterministic domains and propose a different technique to solve agent planning programs, which is based on iteratively solving classical planning problems and on exploiting goal preferences and plan adaptation methods. Finally, we study the effectiveness of this approach for deterministic domains through an experimental analysis on well-known planning domains.},

abstract = {Adaptive Planning is an approach to planning in the cammansense domain. An adaptive planner takes advantage of the habitual nature of many of the planning situations for which tt plans by basing its activities on a memory of pre-stored plans. A critical issue, and the subject of this paper, is the question of flexibility: How does an adaptive plonner refit an old plan in order to meet the demands of some new planning situation? An adaptive planner refits prestored plans by constructing on interpretation of the situation in which it is engaged. Key elements in the theory of adoptive planning are its treatment of specific plans and o notion of situation matching. The theory of adaptive planning has been modeled by a computer program called PLEXUS.},

abstract = {Many real world problems involve hybrid systems, subject to (continuous) physical effects and controlled by (discrete) digital equipments. Indeed, many efforts are being made to extend the current planning systems and modelling languages to support such kind of domains. However, hybrid systems often present also a nonlinear behaviour and planning with continuous nonlinear change that is still a challenging issue.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}In this paper we present the UPMurphi tool, a universal planner based on the discretise and validate approach that is capable of reasoning with mixed discrete/continuous domains, fully respecting the semantics of PDDL+. Given an initial discretisation, the hybrid system is discretised and given as input to UPMurphi, which performs universal planning on such an approximated model and checks the correctness of the results. If the validation fails, the approach is repeated by appropriately refining the discretisation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p class="a-plus-plus"{\textgreater}To show the effectiveness of our approach, the paper presents two real hybrid domains where universal planning has been successfully performed using the UPMurphi tool.},
