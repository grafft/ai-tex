abstract = {Conversational software, that is software with which a user can con- verse in a natural language such as English or Dutch, can be classified into two distinct categories: chatbots and dialogue systems. Chatbots work according to the principle of pattern matching where user input is matched to a fixed response. In dialogue systems, user input is parsed into some semantical rep- resentation. This representation is then used by a component called a dialogue manager to determine what the response should be. A dia- logue manager maintains a state of the conversation by tracking who spoke last, what knowledge is private and shared, the current goal, what plan should be followed to resolve an open issue and how much of the user input was understood. Both categories of systems have their advantages and disadvan- tages. Chatbot systems are trivial to build and maintain, but are too simplistic for applications that do more than answering frequently asked questions. Dialogue systems on the other hand are harder to develop and maintain, can deal with less variety in user input, but are capable of handling and generating all kinds of linguistic phenomena such as grounding and information revision. This thesis presents a system that combines ideas from chatbots and dialogue system. This hybrid system doesn't parse natural language into a semantic presentation, but contains a dialogue manager that can handle natural language directly. This system would make it easy to implement and maintain new domains even when the developer has little or no knowledge of computational linguistics. The system would also be able to deal with a variety of linguistic phenomena. A statistics tutor has been implemented using this hybrid system with which three students interacted. This shows that it's reasonably easy to build and maintain new domains using this approach. It is also shown that the statistics tutor is able to deal with phenomena such as grounding, question accommodation and information revision.},

@article{Abdul-Kader2015,
abstract = {—Human-Computer Speech is gaining momentum as a technique of computer interaction. There has been a recent upsurge in speech based search engines and assistants such as Siri, Google Chrome and Cortana. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques such as NLTK for Python can be applied to analyse speech, and intelligent responses can be found by designing an engine to provide appropriate human like responses. This type of programme is called a Chatbot, which is the focus of this study. This paper presents a survey on the techniques used to design Chatbots and a comparison is made between different design techniques from nine carefully selected papers according to the main methods adopted. These papers are representative of the significant improvements in Chatbots in the last decade. The paper discusses the similarities and differences in the techniques and examines in particular the Loebner prize-winning Chatbots.},

@article{Wahlster1989,
abstract = {This chapter surveys the field of user modeling in artificial intelligence dialog systems. First, reasons why user modeling has become so important in the last few years are pointed out, and definitions are proposed for the terms 'user model' and 'user modeling component'. Research within and outside of artificial intelligence which is related to user modeling in dialog systems is discussed. In Section 2, techniques for constructing user models in the course of a dialog are presented and, in Section 3, recent proposals for representing a wide range of assumptions about a user's beliefs and goals in a system's knowledge base are surveyed. Examples for the application of user models in systems developed to date are then given, and some social implications discussed. Finally, unsolved problems like coping with collective beliefs or resource-limited processes are investigated, and prospects for application- oriented research are outlined. Although the survey is restricted to user models in natural- language dialog systems, most of the concepts and methods discussed can be extended to AI dialog systems in general.},

abstract = {Current spoken dialogue systems are often criticised because they lack natural behaviour. In this thesis, a model to facilitate the development of user-friendly dialogues for information and control systems (e.g. travel-booking or smart room control systems) is created in order to address this problem. This also includes a study about the users' preferences, the classification of utterances according to intention and answer type and the development of a dialogue engine that can process dialogues based on this model.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe developed model describes the dialogue flow and the combination of questions, answers and the resulting actions. Features like mixed initiative, open-ended questions, subdialogues and adaptable phrasings of system utterances lead to more natural dialogues and increase the usability of dialogue systems while linguistic datatypes, abstract question descriptions in connection with answer types and language generation methods enormously facilitate the definition of such dialogues for the developer. The separation of dialogue model and dialogue engine makes possible the reuse of base functionalities und prevents the mixing of execution logic and dialogue knowledge. The engine contains dialogue acts to classify user utterances and to prevent ambiguities as well as language understanding modules to identify the user's goal. In addition, it infers the next dialogue step under consideration of the specified dialogue behaviour.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nBy implementing the Natural Dialogue System (NADIA), that runs the XML-based model, the functionality is proven.},

@article{Chai2001,
abstract = {This paper describes a web-based dialog system – Natural Language Sales Assistant (NLSA) – that helps users find relevant information about products and services in e-commerce sites. The system leverages technologies in natural language processing and human computer interaction to create a faster and more intuitive way of interacting with websites. By combining traditional AI rule-based technology with taxonomy mapping, the system is able to accommodate both customer and business requirements. Our user studies have demonstrated that, in the context of e-commerce, users preferred the natural language enabled navigation over menu-driven navigation (79{\%} to 21{\%} users). In addition, compared to a menu driven system, the average number of clicks used in the natural language system was reduced by 63.2{\%} and the average time was reduced by 33.3{\%}. The NLSA system is currently deployed by IBM as a live pilot and we are collecting real user feedback. We believe that conversational interfaces like that of NLSA offer the ultimate personalization and can greatly enhance the user experience for websites.},

abstract = {Two key objectives of conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) systems are (1) eliciting case facts in a manner that minimizes the user's burden in terms of resources such as time, information cost, and cognitive load, and (2) integrating CBR with other problem solving modalities. This paper proposes an architecture that addresses both these goals by integrating CBR with a discourse-oriented dialogue engine. The dialogue engine determines when CBR or other problem-solving tech- niques are needed to achieve pending discourse goals. Conversely, the CBR component has the full resources of a dialogue engine to handle topic changes, interruptions, clarification questions by either the user or the system, and other speech acts that arise in problem-solving dialogues. 1},

abstract = {We explore the plausibility of using automated spoken dialog systems (SDS) for administer- ing survey interviews. Because the goals of a survey dialog system differ from more tradi- tional information-seeking and transactional applications, different measures of task accu- racy and success may be warranted. We report a large-scale experimental evaluation of an SDS that administered survey interviews with questions drawn from government and social scientific surveys. We compare two dialog confirmation strategies: (1) a traditional strate- gy of explicit confirmation on low-confidence recognition; and (2) no confirmation. With ex- plicit confirmation, the small percentage of re- sidual errors had little to no impact on survey data measurement. Even without confirmation, while there are significantly more errors, im- pact on the substantive conclusions of the sur- vey is still very limited.},
