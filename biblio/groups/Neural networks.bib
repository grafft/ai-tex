abstract = {A central criticism of standard theoretical approaches to constructing stable, recurrent model networks is that the synaptic connection weights need to be finely-tuned. This criticism is severe because proposed rules for learning these weights have been shown to have various limitations to their biological plausibility. Hence it is unlikely that such rules are used to continuously fine-tune the network in vivo. We describe a learning rule that is able to tune synaptic weights in a biologically plausible manner. We demonstrate and test this rule in the context of the oculomotor integrator, showing that only known neural signals are needed to tune the weights. We demonstrate that the rule appropriately accounts for a wide variety of experimental results, and is robust under several kinds of perturbation. Furthermore, we show that the rule is able to achieve stability as good as or better than that provided by the linearly optimal weights often used in recurrent models of the integrator. Finally, we discuss how this rule can be generalized to tune a wide variety of recurrent attractor networks, such as those found in head direction and path integration systems, suggesting that it may be used to tune a wide variety of stable neural systems.},

abstract = {Deep machine learning offers a comprehensive framework for extracting meaningful features from complex observations in an unsupervised manner. The majority of deep learning architectures described in the literature primarily focus on extracting spatial features. However, in real-world settings, capturing temporal dependencies in observations is critical for accurate inference. This paper introduces an enhancement to DeSTIN - a compositional deep learning architecture in which each layer consists of multiple instantiations of a common node - that learns to represent spatiotemporal patterns in data based on a novel recurrent clustering algorithm. Contrary to mainstream deep architectures, such as deep belief networks where layer-by-layer training is assumed, each of the nodes in the proposed architecture is trained independently and in parallel. Moreover, top-down and bottom-up information flows facilitate rich feature formation. A semi-supervised setting is demonstrated achieving state-of-the-art results on the MNIST classification benchmarks. A GPU implementation is discussed further accentuating the scalability properties of the proposed framework. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Recent research in the deep learning field has produced a plethora of new architectures. At the same time, a growing number of groups are applying deep learning to new applications. Some of these groups are likely to be composed of inexperienced deep learning practitioners who are baffled by the dizzying array of architecture choices and therefore opt to use an older architecture (i.e., Alexnet). Here we attempt to bridge this gap by mining the collective knowledge contained in recent deep learning research to discover underlying principles for designing neural network architectures. In addition, we describe several architectural innovations, including Fractal of FractalNet network, Stagewise Boosting Networks, and Taylor Series Networks (our Caffe code and prototxt files is available at https://github.com/iPhysicist/CNNDesignPatterns). We hope others are inspired to build on our preliminary work.},

abstract = {This paper explores the combination of self-organizing map (SOM) and feedback, in order to represent sequences of inputs. In general, neural networks with time-delayed feedback represent time implicitly, by combining current inputs and past activities. It has been difficult to apply this approach to SOM, because feedback generates instability during learning. We demonstrate a solution to this problem, based on a nonlinearity. The result is a generalization of SOM that learns to represent sequences recursively. We demonstrate that the resulting representations are adapted to the temporal statistics of the input series. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This book is aimed to provide an overview of general deep learning methodology and its applications to a variety of signal and information processing tasks. The application areas are chosen with the following three criteria: 1) expertise or knowledge of the authors; 2) the application areas that have already been transformed by the successful use of deep learning technology, such as speech recognition and computer vision; and 3) the application areas that have the potential to be impacted significantly by deep learning and that have gained concentrated research efforts, including natural language and text processing, information retrieval, and multimodal information processing empowered by multi-task deep learning. In Chapter 1, we provide the background of deep learning, as intrinsically connected to the use of multiple layers of nonlinear transformations to derive features from the sensory signals such as speech and visual images. In the most recent literature, deep learning is embodied also as representation learning, which involves a hierarchy of features or concepts where higher-level representations of them are defined from lower-level ones and where the same lower-level representations help to define higher-level ones. In Chapter 2, a brief historical account of deep learning is presented. In particular, selected chronological development of speech recognition is used to illustrate the recent impact of deep learning that has become a dominant technology in speech recognition industry within only a few years since the start of a collaboration between academic and industrial researchers in applying deep learning to speech recognition. In Chapter 3, a three-way classification scheme for a large body of work in deep learning is developed. We classify a growing number of deep learning techniques into unsupervised, supervised, and hybrid categories, and present qualitative descriptions and a literature survey for each category. From Chapter 4 to Chapter 6, we discuss in detail three popular deep networks and related learning methods, one in each category. Chapter 4 is devoted to deep autoencoders as a prominent example of the unsupervised deep learning techniques. Chapter 5 gives a major example in the hybrid deep network category, which is the discriminative feed-forward neural network for supervised learning with many layers initialized using layer-by-layer generative, unsupervised pre-training. In Chapter 6, deep stacking networks and several of the variants are discussed in detail, which exemplify the discriminative or supervised deep learning techniques in the three-way categorization scheme. In Chapters 7-11, we select a set of typical and successful applications of deep learning in diverse areas of signal and information processing and of applied artificial intelligence. In Chapter 7, we review the applications of deep learning to speech and audio processing, with emphasis on speech recognition organized according to several prominent themes. In Chapters 8, we present recent results of applying deep learning to language modeling and natural language processing. Chapter 9 is devoted to selected applications of deep learning to information retrieval including Web search. In Chapter 10, we cover selected applications of deep learning to image object recognition in computer vision. Selected applications of deep learning to multi-modal processing and multi-task learning are reviewed in Chapter 11. Finally, an epilogue is given in Chapter 12 to summarize what we presented in earlier chapters and to discuss future challenges and directions.},

In speech recognition, for example, an acoustic signal is transcribed into words or sub-word units. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence learners that would seem well suited to such tasks. However, because they require pre-segmented training data, and post-processing to transform their out- puts into label sequences, their applicability has so far been limited. This paper presents a novel method for training RNNs to label un- segmented sequences directly, thereby solv- ing both problems. An experiment on the TIMIT speech corpus demonstrates its ad- vantages over both a baseline HMM and a hybrid HMM-RNN.},

abstract = {Convolutional networks are at the core of most state-of-the-art computer vision solutions for a wide variety of tasks. Since 2014 very deep convolutional networks started to become mainstream, yielding substantial gains in various benchmarks. Although increased model size and computational cost tend to translate to immediate quality gains for most tasks (as long as enough labeled data is provided for training), computational efficiency and low parameter count are still enabling factors for various use cases such as mobile vision and big-data scenarios. Here we are exploring ways to scale up networks in ways that aim at utilizing the added computation as efficiently as possible. We benchmark our methods on the ILSVRC 2012 classification challenge validation set and demonstrate substantial gains over the state of the art via to carefully factorized convolutions and aggressive regularization: 21.2{\%} top-1 and 5.6{\%} top-5 error for single frame evaluation using a network with a computational cost of 5 billion multiply-adds per inference and with using less than 25 million parameters.},

The main hallmark of this architecture is the improved utilization of the computing resources inside the network. This was achieved by a carefully crafted design that allows for increasing the depth and width of the network while keeping the computational budget constant. To optimize quality, the architectural decisions were based on the Hebbian principle and the intuition of multi-scale processing.

This is accomplished by constructing a dynamical system that has solutions proportional to the probability distribution over the stimulus space, but with a constant of proportionality adjusted to provide a local estimate of the probability of the recent observations of stimulus-dependent activity-given model parameters. Next, we transform this exact equation to generate nonlinear equations for the exact evolution of log likelihood and log-likelihood ratios and show that when the input has low amplitude, linear rate models for both the likelihood and the log-likelihood functions follow naturally from these equations. We use these four explicit representations of the probability distribution to argue that, in contrast to the arguments of previous work, the dynamical system for the exact evolution of the likelihood (as opposed to the log likelihood or log-likelihood ratios) not only can be mapped onto a biologically plausible network but is also more consistent with physiological observations.},

abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks have been central to the largest advances in image recognition performance in recent years. One example is the Inception architecture that has been shown to achieve very good performance at relatively low computational cost. Recently, the introduction of residual connections in conjunction with a more traditional architecture has yielded state-of-the-art performance in the 2015 ILSVRC challenge; its performance was similar to the latest generation Inception-v3 network. This raises the question of whether there are any benefit in combining the Inception architecture with residual connections. Here we give clear empirical evidence that training with residual connections accelerates the training of Inception networks significantly. There is also some evidence of residual Inception networks outperforming similarly expensive Inception networks without residual connections by a thin margin. We also present several new streamlined architectures for both residual and non-residual Inception networks. These variations improve the single-frame recognition performance on the ILSVRC 2012 classification task significantly. We further demonstrate how proper activation scaling stabilizes the training of very wide residual Inception networks. With an ensemble of three residual and one Inception-v4, we achieve 3.08 percent top-5 error on the test set of the ImageNet classification (CLS) challenge},

In this work, we employ ideas from metric learning based on deep neural features and from recent advances that augment neural networks with external memories. Our framework learns a network that maps a small labelled support set and an unlabelled example to its label, obviating the need for fine-tuning to adapt to new class types. We then define one-shot learning problems on vision (using Omniglot, ImageNet) and language tasks. Our algorithm improves one-shot accuracy on ImageNet from 87.6{\%} to 93.2{\%} and from 88.0{\%} to 93.8{\%} on Omniglot compared to competing approaches.

We find conditions under which a simple feedforward computation is a very good initialization for inference, after the input units are clamped to observed values. It means that after the feedforward initialization, the recurrent network is very close to a fixed point of the network dynamics, where the energy gradient is 0. The main condition is that consecutive layers form a good auto-encoder, or more generally that different groups of inputs into the unit (in particular, bottom-up inputs on one hand, top-down inputs on the other hand) are consistent with each other, producing the same contribution into the total weighted sum of inputs. In biological terms, this would correspond to having each dendritic branch correctly predicting the aggregate input from all the dendritic branches, i.e., the soma potential. This is consistent with the prediction that the synaptic weights into dendritic branches such as those of the apical and basal dendrites of pyramidal cells are trained to minimize the prediction error made by the dendritic branch when the target is the somatic activity. Whereas previous work has shown how to achieve fast negative phase inference (when the model is unclamped) in a predictive recurrent model, this contribution helps to achieve fast positive phase inference (when the target output is clamped) in such recurrent neural models.},

abstract = {This study aims to develop a generalized framework of an SOM called a modular network SOM (mnSOM). The mnSOM has an array structure consisting of functional modules that are trainable neural networks, e.g., multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), instead of the vector units of the conventional SOM. In the case of MLP-modules, an mnSOM learns a group of systems or functions in terms of the input-output relationships in parallel with generating a feature map of them. Thus an mnSOM with MLP modules is an SOM in function space rather than in vector space. In this paper, first, as an example, we focus on a class of mnSOM that consists of MLP modules and introduce the architecture and algorithm. Then, a more generalized framework is described. Finally, some simulation results of an MLP-module-mnSOM are presented. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Deep architectures are composed of multiple levels of non-linear operations, such as in neural nets with many hidden layers or in complicated propositional formulae re-using many sub-formulae. Searching the parameter space of deep architectures is a difficult task, but learning algorithms such as those for Deep Belief Networks have recently been proposed to tackle this problem with notable success, beating the state-of-the-art in certain areas.

It was not previously known whether, in practice, such overestimations are common, whether this harms performance, and whether they can generally be prevented. In this paper, we answer all these questions affirmatively. In particular, we first show that the recent DQN algorithm, which combines Q-learning with a deep neural network, suffers from substantial overestimations in some games in the Atari 2600 domain. We then show that the idea behind the Double Q-learning algorithm, which was introduced in a tabular setting, can be generalized to work with large-scale function approximation. We propose a specific adaptation to the DQN algorithm and show that the resulting algorithm not only reduces the observed overestimations, as hypothesized, but that this also leads to much better performance on several games.},

abstract = {A neural network model for a mechanism of visual pattern recognition is proposed in this paper. The network is self-organized by “learning without a teacher”, and acquires an ability to recognize stimulus patterns based on the geometrical similarity (Gestalt) of their shapes without affected by their positions. This network is given a nickname “neocognitron”. After completion of self-organization, the network has a structure similar to the hierarchy model of the visual nervous system proposed by Hubel and Wiesel. The network consits of an input layer (photoreceptor array) followed by a cascade connection of a number of modular structures, each of which is composed of two layers of cells connected in a cascade. The first layer of each module consists of “S-cells”, which show characteristics similar to simple cells or lower order hypercomplex cells, and the second layer consists of “C-cells” similar to complex cells or higher order hypercomplex cells. The afferent synapses to each S-cell have plasticity and are modifiable. The network has an ability of unsupervised learning: We do not need any “teacher” during the process of self-organization, and it is only needed to present a set of stimulus patterns repeatedly to the input layer of the network. The network has been simulated on a digital computer. After repetitive presentation of a set of stimulus patterns, each stimulus pattern has become to elicit an output only from one of the C-cell of the last layer, and conversely, this C-cell has become selectively responsive only to that stimulus pattern. That is, none of the C-cells of the last layer responds to more than one stimulus pattern. The response of the C-cells of the last layer is not affected by the pattern's position at all. Neither is it affected by a small change in shape nor in size of the stimulus pattern.},

abstract = {We introduce Equilibrium Propagation (e-prop), a learning algorithm for energy-based models. This algorithm involves only one kind of neural computation both for the first phase (when the prediction is made) and the second phase (after the target is revealed) of training. Contrary to backpropagation in feedforward networks, there is no need for special computation in the second phase of our learning algorithm. Equilibrium Propagation combines features of Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: the algorithm computes the exact gradient of a well defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of e-prop corresponds to only nudging the first-phase fixed point towards a configuration that has lower cost value. In the case of a multi-layer supervised neural network, the output units are slightly nudged towards their target, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the network. The theory developed in this paper shows that the signal 'back-propagated' during this second phase actually contains information about the error derivatives, which we use to implement a learning rule proved to perform gradient descent with respect to the objective function. Thus, this work makes it more plausible that a mechanism similar to backpropagation could be implemented by brains.},

abstract = {Recently there has been an outburst of interest in extending topographic maps of vectorial data to more general data structures, such as sequences or trees. However, there is no general consensus as to how best to process sequences using topographic maps, and this topic remains an active focus of neurocomputational research. The representational capabilities and internal representations of the models are not well understood. Here, we rigorously analyze a generalization of the self-organizing map (SOM) for processing sequential data, recursive SOM(RecSOM) (Voegtlin, 2002), as a nonautonomous dynamical system consisting of a set of fixed input maps. We argue that contractive fixed-input maps are likely to produce Markovian organizations of receptive fields on the RecSOM map. We derive bounds on parameter beta (weighting the importance of importing past information when processing sequences) under which contractiveness of the fixed-input maps is guaranteed. Some generalizations of SOM contain a dynamic module responsible for processing temporal contexts as an integral part of the model. We show that Markovian topographic maps of sequential data can be produced using a simple fixed (nonadaptable) dynamic module externally feeding a standard topographic model designed to process static vectorial data of fixed dimensionality (e.g., SOM). However, by allowing trainable feedback connections, one can obtain Markovian maps with superior memory depth and topography preservation. We elaborate on the importance of non-Markovian organizations in topographic maps of sequential data.},

Equilibrium Propagation shares similarities with Contrastive Hebbian Learning and Contrastive Divergence while solving the theoretical issues of both algorithms: our algorithm computes the gradient of a well defined objective function. Because the objective function is defined in terms of local perturbations, the second phase of Equilibrium Propagation corresponds to only nudging the prediction (fixed point, or stationary distribution) towards a configuration that reduces prediction error. In the case of a recurrent multi-layer supervised network, the output units are slightly nudged towards their target in the second phase, and the perturbation introduced at the output layer propagates backward in the hidden layers. We show that the signal 'back-propagated' during this second phase corresponds to the propagation of error derivatives and encodes the gradient of the objective function, when the synaptic update corresponds to a standard form of spike-timing dependent plasticity. This work makes it more plausible that a mechanism similar to Backpropagation could be implemented by brains, since leaky integrator neural computation performs both inference and error back-propagation in our model. The only local difference between the two phases is whether synaptic changes are allowed or not.},

abstract = {In this paper we present a new self-organizing neural network, which builds a spatiotemporal model of an input temporal sequence inductively. The network is an extension of Kohonen's Self-organizing Map with a modified Hebb's rule for update of temporal synapses. The model building behavior is shown on inductive learning of a transition matrix from a data generated by a Markov Chain.},
