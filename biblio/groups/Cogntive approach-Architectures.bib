abstract = {In this paper we present a broad overview of the last 40 years of research on cognitive architectures. Although the number of existing architectures is nearing several hundred, most of the existing surveys do not reflect this growth and focus on a handful of well-established architectures. Thus, in this survey we wanted to shift the focus towards a more inclusive and high-level overview of the research on cognitive architectures. Our final set of 85 architectures includes 49 that are still actively developed, and borrow from a diverse set of disciplines, spanning areas from psychoanalysis to neuroscience. To keep the length of this paper within reasonable limits we discuss only the core cognitive abilities, such as perception, attention mechanisms, action selection, memory, learning and reasoning. In order to assess the breadth of practical applications of cognitive architectures we gathered information on over 900 practical projects implemented using the cognitive architectures in our list. We use various visualization techniques to highlight overall trends in the development of the field. In addition to summarizing the current state-of-the-art in the cognitive architecture research, this survey describes a variety of methods and ideas that have been tried and their relative success in modeling human cognitive abilities, as well as which aspects of cognitive behavior need more research with respect to their mechanistic counterparts and thus can further inform how cognitive science might progress.},

abstract = {This survey paper discusses the topic of autonomous learning in psychologically-oriented cognitive architectures and reviews some of the most popular cognitive architectures used in psychology, namely ACT-R, Soar, and Clarion. Autonomous learning is critical in the development of cognitive agents, and several learning-related desiderata useful for 'psychological' cognitive architectures are proposed. This article shows that all the reviewed cognitive architectures include some form of explicit ('symbolic') and implicit ('subsymbolic') learning. Additionally, ACT-R and Clarion are shown to include a top-down learning algorithm (from explicit to implicit), and Clarion also includes a bottom-up learning process (from implicit to explicit). Two simulation examples are presented with each cognitive architecture to illustrate the autonomous learning capacities of each modeling paradigm. While Clarion is more autonomous (requiring less a priori knowledge), Soar and ACT-R have so far been used in more complex tasks. The presentation concludes with some general considerations for future work. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Sandamirskaya2015a,
abstract = {Robots controlled by the state of the art cognitive architectures are still far behind animals in their capabilities to learn complex skills and autonomously adapt to unexpected circumstances. The neurocognitive architecture proposed in this paper addresses the problem of learning and execution of hierarchical behaviors and complex skills. Learning is addressed both on the level of individual elementary behaviors and goal-directed sequences of actions. The proposed architecture comprises a Dynamic Neural Fields (DNFs) implementation of the low-level elementary behaviors and a Functional System Network (FSN) tying these behaviors in goal-directed sequences. The DNF framework enables a continuous, dynamical representation of perceptual features and motor parameters, which may be directly coupled to the robot's sensors and motors. Attractor states and instabilities of the DNFs account for segregation of cognitive states and mark behaviorally relevant events in the continuous flow of sensorimotor dynamics. The FSN, in its turn, comprises dynamical elements that can be arranged in a multilayered network by a learning process, in which new layers and elementary behaviors are added on demand. In our architecture, the FSN controls adaptation processes in the already acquired neural-dynamic elementary behaviors, as well as formation of new elementary behaviors. Combination of the DNF and FSN frameworks in a neurocognitive architecture NARLE enables pervasive learning both on the level of individual behaviors and goal-directed sequence, contributing to the progress towards more adaptive intelligent robotic systems, capable to learn new tasks and extend their behavioral repertoire in stochastic real-world environments.},

The makeup of the architecture helps to coordinate planful activities with real-time behaviours for dealing with dynamic environments. In recent years, other architectures have been created with similar attributes but two features distinguish the 3T architecture: (1) a variety of useful software tools have been created to help implement this architecture on multiple real robots; and (2) this architecture, or parts of it, have been implemented on a variety of very different robot systems using different processors, operating systems, effectors and sensor suites.},

abstract = {Programming language and library designers often debate the usability of particular design choices. These choices may impact many developers, yet scientific evidence for them is rarely provided. Cognitive models of program comprehension have existed for over thirty years, but the lack of quantitative (operational) validations for their internal components limits their utility for usability studies. To ease the burden of quantifying these existing models, we recommend using the ACT-R cognitive architecture - a simulation framework for psychological models. In this paper, we review the history of cognitive modeling in the psychology of programming. We provide an overview of the ACT-R cognitive architecture, and show how it could be used to fill in the gaps of an existing, yet incomplete, quantitative model (the Cognitive Complexity Metric). Lastly, we discuss the potential benefits and challenges associated with building a comprehensive cognitive model on top of a cognitive architecture.},

The theory is applied to modeling the data from a study by Qin, Anderson, Silk, Stenger, {\&} Carter (2004) in which children learn to solve linear equations and perfect their skills over a 6-day period. Functional MRI data show that: (a) a motor region tracks the output of equation solutions, (b) a prefrontal region tracks the retrieval of declarative information, (c) a parietal region tracks the transformation of mental representations of the equation, (d) an anterior cingulate region tracks the setting of goal information to control the information flow, and (e) a caudate region tracks the firing of productions in the ACT-R model. The article concludes with an architectural comparison of the competence children display in this task and the competence that monkeys have shown in tasks that require manipulations of sequences of elements.},

abstract = {The problem of the thinking process modeling is considered within the context of Dynamical Theory of Information. The proposed definition for thinking process is based on listing its main goals and functions. A set of various type neural processors is considered to reveal necessary and sufficient combination to implement these basic functions. It is shown that, according to DTI, the artificial thinking system is to be divided into two subsystems, where the first subsystem provides generation of information and learning, the second one - storage and application of the information. This correlates with presence of two hemispheres of the human brain, one of them is believed to produce the intuition, while the other one being responsible for the logical thinking. A particular version of the thinking-system architecture is proposed. It is shown that in the course of evolution, the system is progressively growing from low imaginary information levels, through semantic levels (where the information has sense for this individual system only), up to high abstract levels that could be verbalized to be generally realized. An interpretation of intuitive and logical thinking is given. Our approach, being close to that common for BICA, does differ in certain points. We are not dealing with the active agents that are a priori endowed with emotions, motivations, and comprehension. Instead, starting with just formal (but dynamical) neurons, the system itself, due to the self-organizing nonlinear interactions of the neuron ensembles, could produce semantic and abstract information, and perceive the verbalized one. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Chernavskaya2015,
abstract = {Abstract This article represents an extension of authors' previous papers (Chernavskaya, Chernavskii, Karp, Nikitin, {\&} Shchepetov, 2012, 2013) in modeling cognitive systems on the base of the Dynamical Theory of Information. The paper focuses on the problem of account for emotions in artificial system. The main hypothesis consists in the assumption that emotions inherent in a living system could be simulated by variation of amplitude of the occasional component (noise) inherently embedded into the architecture of artificial system. Within this concept, increasing noise amplitude should correspond to negative emotions (anxiety), while its decreasing provides positive emotions (relaxation, pleasure). A rapid up-and-down spike in the noise amplitude could imitate a laugh. This hypothesis is secured by incorporation of an additional dynamical variable that represents an analogy to the compound of neural mediators in human beings. The system of linked equations in terms of “noise amplitude – neurotransmitter compound” is proposed to describe mutual influence of the cognitive process and emotional component. The model permits to reproduce qualitatively certain prominent effects typical for human emotional reactions (like stress and shock).},

@article{Petersen2015a,
abstract = {Most accounts of human cognitive architectures have focused on computational accounts of cognition while making little contact with the study of anatomical structures and physiological processes. Arenewed convergence between neurobiology and cognition is well under way. A promising area arises from the overlap between systems/cognitive neuroscience on the one side and the discipline of network science on the other. Neuroscience increasingly adopts network tools and concepts to describe the operation of collections of brain regions. Beyond just providing illustrative metaphors, network science offers a theoretical framework for approaching brain structure and function as a multi-scale system composed of networks of neurons, cir- cuits, nuclei, cortical areas, and systems of areas. This paper views large-scale networks at the level of areas and systems, mostly on the basis of data from human neuroimaging, and how this view of network structure and function has begun to illuminate our understanding of the biological basis of cognitive architectures.},

@article{Hiatt2012,
abstract = {Our interest is in developing embodied cognitive systems. In the majority of work on cognitive modeling, the focus is on generating models that can perform specific tasks in order to understand specific reasoning processes. This approach has traditionally been exceptionally successful at accomplishing its goal. The approach encounters limitations, however, when the cognitive models are going to be used in an embodied way (e.g., on a robot). Namely, the models are too narrow to operate in the real world due to its unpredictability. In this paper, we argue that one key way for cognitive agents to better operate in real-world environments is to be able to identify and explain unexpected situations in the world; in other words, to perform explanatory reasoning. In this paper, we introduce a framework for explanatory reasoning that describes a way for cognitive agents to achieve this capability. ?? 2012.},

@article{Samsonovich2013,
abstract = {Human-like artificial emotional intelligence is vital for integration of future robots into the human society. This work introduces a general framework for representation and processing of emotional contents in a cognitive architecture, called "emotional biologically inspired cognitive architecture" (eBICA). Unlike in previous attempts, in this framework emotional elements are added virtually to all cognitive representations and processes by modifying the main building blocks of the prototype architectures. The key elements are appraisals associated as attributes with schemas and mental states, moral schemas that control patterns of appraisals and represent social emotions, and semantic spaces that give values to appraisals. Proposed principles are tested in an experiment involving human subjects and virtual agents, based on a simple paradigm in imaginary virtual world. It is shown that with moral schemas, but probably not without them, eBICA can account for human behavior in the selected paradigm. The model sheds light on clustering of social emotions and allows for their elegant mathematical description. The new framework will be suitable for implementation of believable emotional intelligence in artifacts, necessary for emotionally informed behavior, collaboration of virtual partners with humans, and self-regulated learning of virtual agents. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Samsonovich2018,
abstract = {The future of artificial intelligence (AI) depends on whether intelligent agents become human-like in their cognitive capabilities, giving rise to creative Cobots and social Actors that will inherit human values and get accepted by the society as equal minds. This expected transition requires the development of several key capabilities in AI, including social-emotional and narrative intelligence, resulting in believability and trustworthiness, and also human-like learnability and creativity. This work is devoted to the key element that enables social-emotional intelligence in artifacts: the semantic map. For this purpose, the notion of semantic mapping is expanded, and its role in a socially-emotional cognitive architecture is articulated, with illustrations by several examples of Cobot and Actor designs. The approach based on the previously introduced cognitive architecture eBICA is selected, that considers feelings and reasoning as connected to each other. The two aspects are intimately intertwined in one dynamical system framework, forming a general-purpose cognitive architecture, the central element of which is a semantic map. Results of preliminary studies along these lines together illustrate the breadth of the variety of potential applications of the new technology.},
