abstract = {The present paper grounds the linguistic cdategorization of space in aspects of visual perception; specifically, the structure of projective spatial terms such as above are grounded in the process of attention and in vector-sum coding of overall direction. This is formalized in the attentional vector-sum (AVS) model. This computational model accurately predicts linguistic acceptability judgments for spatial terms, under a variety of spatial configurations. In 7 experiments, the predictions of the AVS model are tested against those of 3 competing models. The results support the AVS model and disconfirm its competitors. The authors conclude that the structure of linguistic spatial categories can be partially explained in terms of independently motivated perceptual processes.},

abstract = {In this paper, we extend a symbolic association framework to being able to handle missing elements in multimodal sequences. The general scope of the work is the symbolic associations of object-word mappings as it happens in language development on infants. This scenario has been long interested by Artificial Intelligence, Psychology and Neuroscience. In this work, we extend a recent approach for multimodal sequences (visual and audio) to also cope with missing elements in one or both modalities. Our approach uses two parallel Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with a learning rule based on EM-algorithm. It aligns both LSTM outputs via Dynamic Time Warping (DTW). We propose to include an extra step for the combination with max and mean operations for handling missing elements in the sequences. The intuition behind is that the combination acts as a condition selector for choosing the best representation from both LSTMs. We evaluated the proposed extension in three different scenarios: audio sequences with missing elements, visual sequences with missing elements, and sequences with missing elements in both modalities. The performance of our extension reaches better results than the original model and similar results to a unique LSTM trained in one modality, i.e., where the learning problem is less difficult.},

abstract = {Grounded cognition rejects traditional views that cognition is computation on amodal symbols in a modular system, independent of the brain's modal systems for perception, action, and introspection. Instead, grounded cognition proposes that modal simulations, bodily states, and situated action underlie cognition. Accumulating behavioral and neural evidence supporting this view is reviewed from research on perception, memory, knowledge, language, thought, social cognition, and development. Theories of grounded cognition are also reviewed, as are origins of the area and common misperceptions of it. Theoretical, empirical, and methodological issues are raised whose future treatment is likely to affect the growth and impact of grounded cognition.},

@article{Butz2016,
abstract = {This paper proposes how various disciplinary theories of cognition may be combined into a unifying, subsymbolic, computational theory of cognition. The following theories are considered for integration: psychological theories, including the theory of event coding, event segmentation theory, the theory of anticipatory behavioral control, and concept development; artificial intelligence and machine learning theories, including reinforcement learning and generative artificial neural networks; and theories from theoretical and computational neuroscience, including predictive coding and free energybased inference. In the light of such a potential unification, it is discussed how abstract cognitive, conceptualized knowledge and understanding may be learned from actively gathered sensorimotor experiences. The unification rests on the free energybased inference principle, which essentially implies that the brain builds a predictive, generative model of its environment. Neural activityoriented inference causes the continuous adaptation of the currently active predictive encodings. Neural structureoriented inference causes the longer term adaptation of the developing generative model as a whole. Finally, active inference strives for maintaining internal homeostasis, causing goaldirected motor behavior. To learn abstract, hierarchical encodings, however, it is proposed that free energybased inference needs to be enhanced with structural priors, which bias cognitive development towards the formation of particular, behaviorally suitable encoding structures. As a result, it is hypothesized how abstract concepts can develop from, and thus how they are structured by and grounded in, sensorimotor experiences. Moreover, it is sketchedout how symbollike thought can be generated by a temporarily active set of predictive encodings, which constitute a distributed neural attractor in the form of an interactive freeenergy minimum. The activated, interactive network attractor essentially characterizes the semantics of a concept or a concept composition, such as an actual or imagined situation in our environment. Temporal successions of attractors then encode unfolding semantics, which may be generated by a behavioral or mental interaction with an actual or imagined situation in our environment. Implications, further predictions, possible verification and falsifications, as well as potential enhancements into a fully spelledout unified theory of cognition are discussed at the end of the paper.},

abstract = {In real-world applications, the effective integration of learning and reasoning in a cognitive agent model is a difficult task. However, such integration may lead to a better understanding, use and con- struction of more realistic models. Unfortunately, existing models are either oversimplified or require much processing time, which is unsuitable for online learning and reasoning. Currently, con- trolled environments like training simulators do not effectively integrate learning and reasoning. In par- ticular, higher-order concepts and cognitive abili- ties have many unknown temporal relations with the data, making it impossible to represent such re- lationships by hand. We introduce a novel cogni- tive agent model and architecture for online learn- ing and reasoning that seeks to effectively repre- sent, learn and reason in complex training envi- ronments. The agent architecture of the model combines neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation. It is capable of learning new hy- potheses from observed data, and infers new be- liefs based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, it deals with uncertainty and errors in the data using a stochastic inference model in the spirit of Bayesian inference. The validation of the model on real-time simulations and the results presented here indicate the promise of the approach when performing online learning and reasoning in real-world scenar- ios, with possible applications in a range of areas.},

A priori, both visual inputs and auditory inputs are complex analog signals with a large amount of noise and context, and lacking of any segmentation information. In this paper, we address a simple form of this problem: the association of one visual input and one auditory input with each other. We show that the presented model learns both segmentation, recognition and symbolic representation under two simple assumptions: (1) that a symbolic representation exists, and (2) that two different inputs represent the same symbolic structure. Our approach uses two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for multimodal sequence learning and recovers the internal symbolic space using an EM-style algorithm. We compared our model against LSTM in three different multimodal datasets: digit, letter and word recognition. The performance of our model reached similar results to LSTM.},

abstract = {Understanding the world involves extracting the regularities that define the interaction of the behaving organism within this world, and computing the statistical structure characterizing these regularities. This can be based on contingencies of phenomena at various scales ranging from correlations between sensory signals (e.g., motor-proprioceptive loops) to high-level conceptual links (e.g., vocabulary grounding). Multiple cortical areas contain neurons whose receptive fields are tuned for signals co-occurring in multiple modalities. Moreover, the hierarchical organization of the cortex, described within the Convergence Divergence Zone framework, defines an ideal architecture to extract and make use of contingency at increasing levels of complexity. We present an artificial neural network model of the early cortical amodal computations, which we have demonstrated on the humanoid robot iCub. This model explains and predicts findings in neurophysiology and neuropsychology along with being an efficient tool to control the robot. In particular, through exploratory use of the body, the system learns a form of body schema in terms of specific modalities (e.g., arm proprioception, gaze proprioception, vision) and their multimodal contingencies. Once multimodal contingencies have been learned, the system is capable of generating and exploiting internal representations or mental images based on inputs in one of these multiple dimensions. The system thus provides insight on a possible neural substrate for mental imagery within the context of multimodal convergence.},

abstract = {A standard approach in the simulation of language evolution is the use of Language Games to model communicative interactions between intelligent agents. Usually, in such language games, an agent uses the results from its perceptual layer to categorize and to conceptualize world objects, a process named categorization. In this paper, we develop an approach to the categorization process, where the decomposition of reality in meaningful experiences is co- evolved with the lexicon formation in the language game. This approach brings some insights on how meaning might be assigned to symbols, in a dynamic and continuously changing environ- ment being experienced by an agent. In order to do that, we use Barsalou's notion of mental simulation and Ga ¨rdenfors' notion of conceptual spaces such that, together with ESOM neural networks, a cognitive architecture can be developed, where mental concepts formation and lexicon formation are able to co-evolve during a language game. The performance of our cog- nitive architecture is evaluated and the results show that the architecture is able to fulfill its semantics function, by allowing a population of agents to exchange the meaning of linguistic symbols during a naming game, without relying on ‘‘a priori” categorization scheme provided by an external expert or a set of examples for training a neural network in a previous discrim- ination game. These results, beyond bringing evidence on potential ways for symbols to get meaning on a biologically realistic way, open a set of possibilities for further uses of conceptual spaces on a much more complex problem: the grounding of a grammatical language.},

abstract = {Engineering autonomous agents that display rational and goal-directed behavior in dynamic physical environments requires a steady flow of information from sensors to high-level reasoning components. However, while sensors tend to generate noisy and incomplete quantitative data, reasoning often requires crisp symbolic knowledge. The gap between sensing and reasoning is quite wide, and cannot in general be bridged in a single step. Instead, this task requires a more general approach to integrating and organizing multiple forms of information and knowledge processing on different levels of abstraction in a structured and principled manner. We propose knowledge processing middleware as a systematic approach to organizing such processing. Desirable properties are presented and motivated. We argue that a declarative stream-based system is appropriate for the required functionality and present DyKnow, a concrete implemented instantiation of stream-based knowledge processing middleware with a formal semantics. Several types of knowledge processes are defined and motivated in the context of a UAV traffic monitoring application. In the implemented application, DyKnow is used to incrementally bridge the sense-reasoning gap and generate partial logical models of the environment over which metric temporal logical formulas are evaluated. Using such formulas, hypotheses are formed and validated about the type of vehicles being observed. DyKnow is also used to generate event streams representing for example changes in qualitative spatial relations, which are used to detect traffic violations expressed as declarative chronicles. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Human intelligence is the main inspiration for the cognitive robotics field, and language is one of the unique qualities of humans. The increasing interest in acquisition of language in cognitive agents/robots with grounded phenomenon facilitates robotic services in real scenarios in real means through stepping into the shoes of human intelligence. In this paper, a cognitive robotics model is proposed for the ground-ing of a higher-order concept in the sensorimotor experience of humanoid robot. In the proposed model, robot's conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized in a semantic network by using the inputted linguistic description of these words. The meaning of the higher-order word is indirectly grounded in sen-sorimotor primitives through a top-down activation process. Specifically, in the described model, the meaning of the abstract action word is acquired through the combination of already grounded action primitives. Hence, the proposed model with the strength of symbolic computation extends the grounding mechanism to the abstract words category, and also provides a tool (i.e. a practical way) to investigate the link that exists between sensorimotor representation and abstract conceptual knowledge of the cognitive robot. For verification of the proposed model, simulation-experiments have been conducted by using iCub robot data.},

abstract = {There is much recent interest in the idea that we represent our knowledge together with the sensory and motor features that were activated during its acquisition. This paper reviews the evidence for such "embodiment" in the domain of numerical cognition, a traditional stronghold of abstract theories of knowledge representation. The focus is on spatial-numerical associations, such as the SNARC effect (small numbers are associated with left space, larger numbers with right space). Using empirical evidence from behavioral research, I first describe sensory and motor biases induced by SNARC, thus identifying numbers as embodied concepts. Next, I propose a hierarchical relationship between grounded, embodied, and situated aspects of number knowledge. This hierarchical conceptualization helps to understand the variety of SNARC-related findings and yields testable predictions about numerical cognition. I report several such tests, ranging from cross-cultural comparisons of horizontal and vertical SNARC effects (Shaki and Fischer in J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform 38(3):804-809, 2012) to motor cortical activation studies in adults with left- and right-hand counting preferences (Tschentscher et al. in NeuroImage 59:3139-3148, 2012). It is concluded that the diagnostic features for each level of the proposed hierarchical knowledge representation, together with the spatial associations of numbers, make the domain of numerical knowledge an ideal testing ground for embodied cognition research.},

However, the integration of both levels still remains challenging due to the representational gap between the continuous state space on the sensorimotor level and the discrete symbolic entities used in high level reasoning. In this work, we approach the problem of learning a representation of the space which is applicable on both levels. This representation is grounded on the sensorimotor level by means of exploration and on the language level by making use of common sense knowledge. We demonstrate how spatial knowledge can be extracted from these two sources of experience. Combining the resulting knowledge in a systematic way yields a solution to the grounding problem which has the potential to substantially decrease the learning effort.},

Our semiotic cognitive automaton is driven only by the obser- vations it makes and therefore operates based on grounded symbols. A best-case scenario for our automaton involves observations that are univocally interpreted—i.e. distinct observation symbols—and that make reference to a reality characterised by ‘‘hard constraints''. Arithmetic offers such a scenario. The gap between syntax and semantics is also subtle in the case of calculations. Our automaton starts without any a priori knowledge of mathematical for- malisms and not only learns the syntactical rules by which arithmetic operations are solved but also reveals the true meaning of numbers by means of second-order reasoning.},

The extension of grounding phenomenon for abstract words is very important for social interactions of cognitive robots in real scenarios. This paper reviews the strength of symbolic and connectionist methods to address the abstract word grounding problem in cognitive robots. In particular, the presented work is focused on designing and simulating cognitive robotics model to achieve a grounding mechanism for abstract words by using the semantic network approach, as well as examining the utility of connectionist computation for the same problem. Two neuro-robotics models based on feed forward neural network and recurrent neural network are presented to see the pros and cons of connectionist approach. The simulation results and review of attributes of these methods reveal that the proposed symbolic model offers the solution to the problem of grounding abstract words with attributes like high data storage capacity with recall accuracy, structural integrity and temporal sequence handling. Whereas, connectionist computation based solutions give more natural solution to this problem with some shortcomings that include combinatorial ambiguity, low storage capacity and structural rigidity. The presented results are not only important for the advancement in communication system of cognitive robot, also provide evidence for embodied nature of abstract language.},

abstract = {Humans can learn the use of language through physical interaction with their environment and semi-otic communication with other people. It is very important to obtain a computational understanding of how humans can form a symbol system and obtain semiotic skills through their autonomous mental development. Recently, many studies have been conducted on the construction of robotic systems and machine-learning methods that can learn the use of language through embodied multimodal in-teraction with their environment and other systems. Understanding human social interactions and developing a robot that can smoothly communicate with human users in the long term, requires an understanding of the dynamics of symbol systems and is crucially important. The embodied cognition and social interaction of participants gradually change a symbol system in a constructive manner. In this paper, we introduce a field of research called symbol emergence in robotics (SER). SER is a con-structive approach towards an emergent symbol system. The emergent symbol system is socially self-organized through both semiotic communications and physical interactions with autonomous cognitive developmental agents, i.e., humans and developmental robots. Specifically, we describe some state-of-art research topics concerning SER, e.g., multimodal categorization, word discovery, and a double articulation analysis, that enable a robot to obtain words and their embodied meanings from raw sensory–motor information, including visual information, haptic information, auditory information, and acoustic speech signals, in a totally unsupervised manner. Finally, we suggest future directions of research in SER.},

@article{Barsalou1999,
abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},
