abstract = {Humans can learn the use of language through physical interaction with their environment and semi-otic communication with other people. It is very important to obtain a computational understanding of how humans can form a symbol system and obtain semiotic skills through their autonomous mental development. Recently, many studies have been conducted on the construction of robotic systems and machine-learning methods that can learn the use of language through embodied multimodal in-teraction with their environment and other systems. Understanding human social interactions and developing a robot that can smoothly communicate with human users in the long term, requires an understanding of the dynamics of symbol systems and is crucially important. The embodied cognition and social interaction of participants gradually change a symbol system in a constructive manner. In this paper, we introduce a field of research called symbol emergence in robotics (SER). SER is a con-structive approach towards an emergent symbol system. The emergent symbol system is socially self-organized through both semiotic communications and physical interactions with autonomous cognitive developmental agents, i.e., humans and developmental robots. Specifically, we describe some state-of-art research topics concerning SER, e.g., multimodal categorization, word discovery, and a double articulation analysis, that enable a robot to obtain words and their embodied meanings from raw sensory–motor information, including visual information, haptic information, auditory information, and acoustic speech signals, in a totally unsupervised manner. Finally, we suggest future directions of research in SER.},

abstract = {Providing autonomous humanoid robots with the abilities to react in an adaptive and intelligent manner involves low level control and sensing as well as high level reasoning. However, the integration of both levels still remains challenging due to the representational gap between the continuous state space on the sensorimotor level and the discrete symbolic entities used in high level reasoning. In this work, we approach the problem of learning a representation of the space which is applicable on both levels. This representation is grounded on the sensorimotor level by means of exploration and on the language level by making use of common sense knowledge. We demonstrate how spatial knowledge can be extracted from these two sources of experience. Combining the resulting knowledge in a systematic way yields a solution to the grounding problem which has the potential to substantially decrease the learning effort.},

abstract = {In real-world applications, the effective integration of learning and reasoning in a cognitive agent model is a difficult task. However, such integration may lead to a better understanding, use and con- struction of more realistic models. Unfortunately, existing models are either oversimplified or require much processing time, which is unsuitable for online learning and reasoning. Currently, con- trolled environments like training simulators do not effectively integrate learning and reasoning. In par- ticular, higher-order concepts and cognitive abili- ties have many unknown temporal relations with the data, making it impossible to represent such re- lationships by hand. We introduce a novel cogni- tive agent model and architecture for online learn- ing and reasoning that seeks to effectively repre- sent, learn and reason in complex training envi- ronments. The agent architecture of the model combines neural learning with symbolic knowledge representation. It is capable of learning new hy- potheses from observed data, and infers new be- liefs based on these hypotheses. Furthermore, it deals with uncertainty and errors in the data using a stochastic inference model in the spirit of Bayesian inference. The validation of the model on real-time simulations and the results presented here indicate the promise of the approach when performing online learning and reasoning in real-world scenar- ios, with possible applications in a range of areas.},

Here we focus on one such model that has shown promise, that uses polychronization and short term synaptic dynamics to achieve this reverberation, and explore it with respect to different physiological parameters in the brain, including size of the network, number of synaptic connections, small-world connectivity, maximum axonal conduction delays, and type of cells (excitatory or inhibitory).

abstract = {The present paper grounds the linguistic cdategorization of space in aspects of visual perception; specifically, the structure of projective spatial terms such as above are grounded in the process of attention and in vector-sum coding of overall direction. This is formalized in the attentional vector-sum (AVS) model. This computational model accurately predicts linguistic acceptability judgments for spatial terms, under a variety of spatial configurations. In 7 experiments, the predictions of the AVS model are tested against those of 3 competing models. The results support the AVS model and disconfirm its competitors. The authors conclude that the structure of linguistic spatial categories can be partially explained in terms of independently motivated perceptual processes.},

abstract = {Understanding the world involves extracting the regularities that define the interaction of the behaving organism within this world, and computing the statistical structure characterizing these regularities. This can be based on contingencies of phenomena at various scales ranging from correlations between sensory signals (e.g., motor-proprioceptive loops) to high-level conceptual links (e.g., vocabulary grounding). Multiple cortical areas contain neurons whose receptive fields are tuned for signals co-occurring in multiple modalities. Moreover, the hierarchical organization of the cortex, described within the Convergence Divergence Zone framework, defines an ideal architecture to extract and make use of contingency at increasing levels of complexity. We present an artificial neural network model of the early cortical amodal computations, which we have demonstrated on the humanoid robot iCub. This model explains and predicts findings in neurophysiology and neuropsychology along with being an efficient tool to control the robot. In particular, through exploratory use of the body, the system learns a form of body schema in terms of specific modalities (e.g., arm proprioception, gaze proprioception, vision) and their multimodal contingencies. Once multimodal contingencies have been learned, the system is capable of generating and exploiting internal representations or mental images based on inputs in one of these multiple dimensions. The system thus provides insight on a possible neural substrate for mental imagery within the context of multimodal convergence.},

abstract = {Engineering autonomous agents that display rational and goal-directed behavior in dynamic physical environments requires a steady flow of information from sensors to high-level reasoning components. However, while sensors tend to generate noisy and incomplete quantitative data, reasoning often requires crisp symbolic knowledge. The gap between sensing and reasoning is quite wide, and cannot in general be bridged in a single step. Instead, this task requires a more general approach to integrating and organizing multiple forms of information and knowledge processing on different levels of abstraction in a structured and principled manner. We propose knowledge processing middleware as a systematic approach to organizing such processing. Desirable properties are presented and motivated. We argue that a declarative stream-based system is appropriate for the required functionality and present DyKnow, a concrete implemented instantiation of stream-based knowledge processing middleware with a formal semantics. Several types of knowledge processes are defined and motivated in the context of a UAV traffic monitoring application. In the implemented application, DyKnow is used to incrementally bridge the sense-reasoning gap and generate partial logical models of the environment over which metric temporal logical formulas are evaluated. Using such formulas, hypotheses are formed and validated about the type of vehicles being observed. DyKnow is also used to generate event streams representing for example changes in qualitative spatial relations, which are used to detect traffic violations expressed as declarative chronicles. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A standard approach in the simulation of language evolution is the use of Language Games to model communicative interactions between intelligent agents. Usually, in such language games, an agent uses the results from its perceptual layer to categorize and to conceptualize world objects, a process named categorization. In this paper, we develop an approach to the categorization process, where the decomposition of reality in meaningful experiences is co- evolved with the lexicon formation in the language game. This approach brings some insights on how meaning might be assigned to symbols, in a dynamic and continuously changing environ- ment being experienced by an agent. In order to do that, we use Barsalou's notion of mental simulation and Ga ¨rdenfors' notion of conceptual spaces such that, together with ESOM neural networks, a cognitive architecture can be developed, where mental concepts formation and lexicon formation are able to co-evolve during a language game. The performance of our cog- nitive architecture is evaluated and the results show that the architecture is able to fulfill its semantics function, by allowing a population of agents to exchange the meaning of linguistic symbols during a naming game, without relying on ‘‘a priori” categorization scheme provided by an external expert or a set of examples for training a neural network in a previous discrim- ination game. These results, beyond bringing evidence on potential ways for symbols to get meaning on a biologically realistic way, open a set of possibilities for further uses of conceptual spaces on a much more complex problem: the grounding of a grammatical language.},

@article{Barsalou1999,
abstract = {Prior to the twentieth century, theories of knowledge were inherently perceptual. Since then, developments in logic, statistics, and programming languages have inspired amodal theories that rest on principles fundamentally different from those underlying perception. In addition, perceptual approaches have become widely viewed as untenable because they are assumed to implement recording systems, not conceptual systems. A perceptual theory of knowledge is developed here in the context of current cognitive science and neuroscience. During perceptual experience, association areas in the brain capture bottom-up patterns of activation in sensory-motor areas. Later, in a top-down manner, association areas partially reactivate sensory-motor areas to implement perceptual symbols. The storage and reactivation of perceptual symbols operates at the level of perceptual components--not at the level of holistic perceptual experiences. Through the use of selective attention, schematic representations of perceptual components are extracted from experience and stored in memory (e.g., individual memories of green, purr, hot). As memories of the same component become organized around a common frame, they implement a simulator that produces limitless simulations of the component (e.g., simulations of purr). Not only do such simulators develop for aspects of sensory experience, they also develop for aspects of proprioception (e.g., lift, run) and introspection (e.g., compare, memory, happy, hungry). Once established, these simulators implement a basic conceptual system that represents types, supports categorization, and produces categorical inferences. These simulators further support productivity, propositions, and abstract concepts, thereby implementing a fully functional conceptual system. Productivity results from integrating simulators combinatorially and recursively to produce complex simulations. Propositions result from binding simulators to perceived individuals to represent type-token relations. Abstract concepts are grounded in complex simulations of combined physical and introspective events. Thus, a perceptual theory of knowledge can implement a fully functional conceptual system while avoiding problems associated with amodal symbol systems. Implications for cognition, neuroscience, evolution, development, and artificial intelligence are explored.},

@article{Fischer2012,
abstract = {There is much recent interest in the idea that we represent our knowledge together with the sensory and motor features that were activated during its acquisition. This paper reviews the evidence for such "embodiment" in the domain of numerical cognition, a traditional stronghold of abstract theories of knowledge representation. The focus is on spatial-numerical associations, such as the SNARC effect (small numbers are associated with left space, larger numbers with right space). Using empirical evidence from behavioral research, I first describe sensory and motor biases induced by SNARC, thus identifying numbers as embodied concepts. Next, I propose a hierarchical relationship between grounded, embodied, and situated aspects of number knowledge. This hierarchical conceptualization helps to understand the variety of SNARC-related findings and yields testable predictions about numerical cognition. I report several such tests, ranging from cross-cultural comparisons of horizontal and vertical SNARC effects (Shaki and Fischer in J Exp Psychol Hum Percept Perform 38(3):804-809, 2012) to motor cortical activation studies in adults with left- and right-hand counting preferences (Tschentscher et al. in NeuroImage 59:3139-3148, 2012). It is concluded that the diagnostic features for each level of the proposed hierarchical knowledge representation, together with the spatial associations of numbers, make the domain of numerical knowledge an ideal testing ground for embodied cognition research.},

@inproceedings{Raue2015,
abstract = {The problem of how infants learn to associate visual inputs, speech, and internal symbolic representation has long been of interest in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Artificial Intelligence. A priori, both visual inputs and auditory inputs are complex analog signals with a large amount of noise and context, and lacking of any segmentation information. In this paper, we address a simple form of this problem: the association of one visual input and one auditory input with each other. We show that the presented model learns both segmentation, recognition and symbolic representation under two simple assumptions: (1) that a symbolic representation exists, and (2) that two different inputs represent the same symbolic structure. Our approach uses two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for multimodal sequence learning and recovers the internal symbolic space using an EM-style algorithm. We compared our model against LSTM in three different multimodal datasets: digit, letter and word recognition. The performance of our model reached similar results to LSTM.},

The model implements several well-known findings in the literature on early semantic development.

The model represents a 1st step toward providing a formal explanation of the emergence of symbolic behavior in young children.

@article{Targon2016,
abstract = {Through semiotic modelling, a system can retrieve and manipulate its own representational formats to interpret a series of observations; this is in contrast to information processing approaches that require represen- tational formats to be specified beforehand and thus limit the semantic properties that the system can experience. Our semiotic cognitive automaton is driven only by the obser- vations it makes and therefore operates based on grounded symbols. A best-case scenario for our automaton involves observations that are univocally interpreted—i.e. distinct observation symbols—and that make reference to a reality characterised by ‘‘hard constraints''. Arithmetic offers such a scenario. The gap between syntax and semantics is also subtle in the case of calculations. Our automaton starts without any a priori knowledge of mathematical for- malisms and not only learns the syntactical rules by which arithmetic operations are solved but also reveals the true meaning of numbers by means of second-order reasoning.},

@article{Besold2015,
abstract = {After a human-level AI-oriented overview of the status quo in neural-symbolic integration, two research programs aiming at overcoming long-standing challenges in the field are suggested to the community: The first program targets a better understanding of foundational differences and relationships on the level of computational complexity between symbolic and subsymbolic computation and representation, potentially providing explanations for the empirical differences between the paradigms in application scenarios and a foothold for subsequent attempts at overcoming these. The second program suggests a new approach and computational architecture for the cognitively-inspired anchoring of an agent's learning, knowledge formation, and higher reasoning abilities in real-world interactions through a closed neural-symbolic acting/sensing-processing-reasoning cycle, potentially providing new foundations for future agent architectures, multi-agent systems, robotics, and cognitive systems and facilitating a deeper understanding of the development and interaction in human-technological settings.},
