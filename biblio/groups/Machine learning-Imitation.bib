abstract = {Plan recognition, the problem of inferring the goals or plans of an observed agent, is a key el- ement of situation awareness in human-machine and machine-machine interactions for many appli- cations. Some plan recognition algorithms require knowledge about the potential behaviours of the observed agent in the form of a plan library, to- gether with a decision model about how the ob- served agent uses the plan library to make deci- sions. It is however difficult to elicit and specify the decision model a priori. In this paper, we present a recursive neural network model that learns such a decision model automatically. We discuss promis- ing experimental results of the approach with com- parisons to selected state-of-the-art plan recogni- tion algorithms on three benchmark domains. 1},
