abstract = {Planning is motivated by acting. Most of the existing work on automated planning underestimates the reasoning and deliberation needed for acting; it is instead biased towards path-finding methods in a compactly specified state-transition system. Researchers in this AI field have developed many planners, but very few actors. We believe this is one of the main causes of the relatively low deployment of automated planning applications. In this paper, we advocate a change in focus to actors as the primary topic of investigation. Actors are not mere plan executors: they may use planning and other deliberation tools, before and during acting. This change in focus entails two interconnected principles: a hierarchical structure to integrate the actor's deliberation functions, and continual online planning and reasoning throughout the acting process. In the paper, we discuss open problems and research directions toward that objective in knowledge representations, model acquisition and verification, synthesis and refinement, monitoring, goal reasoning, and integration. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Many algorithms have been presented in artificial intelligence for problem solving and planning. Given a goal, these algorithms search for solutions that achieve a goal state by actions or interactions with an environment. However a major assumption is that goals are given, usually by a user directly as input or as part of the problem definition. Furthermore, once given, the goals do not change. Here we formalize the notion that goal specification and goal change are themselves major parts of the problem-solving process. We apply this model to learning in a goal reasoning context. 1.},
