abstract = {The K Shortest Paths (KSPs) problem with non-numerable applications has been researched widely, which aims to compute KSPs between two nodes in a non-decreasing order. However, less effort has been devoted to single-source KSP problem than to single-pair KSP computation, especially by using parallel methods. This paper proposes a Modified Continued Pulse Coupled Neural Network (MCPCNN) model to solve the two kinds of KSP problems. Theoretical analysis of MCPCNN and two algorithms for KSPs computation are presented. By using the parallel pulse transmission characteristic of pulse coupled neural networks, the method is able to find k shortest paths quickly. The computational complexity is only related to the length of the longest shortest path. Simulative results for route planning show that the proposed MCPCNN method for KSPs computation outperforms many other current efficient algorithms.},

abstract = {Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) is suitable for dealing with the classical shortest path problem, because of its autowave characteristic. However, most methods suggest that the autowave of PCNN models should keep a constant speed in finding the shortest paths. This paper proposes a novel self-adaptive autowave pulse-coupled neural network (SAPCNN) model for the shortest path problem. The autowave generated by SAPCNN propagates adaptively according to the current network state, which guarantees it spreads more effectively in finding the shortest paths. Our experiments, which have been carried out for both the shortest paths problem and K shortest paths problem, show that our proposed algorithm outperforms classical algorithms. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Designing intelligent and robust autonomous navigation systems remains a great challenge in mobile robotics. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers an efficient learning technique from expert demonstrations to teach robots how to perform specific tasks without manually specifying the reward function. Most of existing IRL algorithms assume the expert policy to be optimal and deterministic, and are applied to experiments with relatively small-size state spaces. However, in autonomous navigation tasks, the state spaces are frequently large and demonstrations can hardly visit all the states. Meanwhile the expert policy may be non-optimal and stochastic. In this paper, we focus on IRL with large-scale and high-dimensional state spaces by introducing the neural network to generalize the expert's behaviors to unvisited regions of the state space and an explicit policy representation is easily expressed by neural network, even for the stochastic expert policy. An efficient and convenient algorithm, Neural Inverse Reinforcement Learning (NIRL), is proposed. Experimental results on simulated autonomous navigation tasks show that a mobile robot using our approach can successfully navigate to the target position without colliding with unpredicted obstacles, largely reduce the learning time, and has a good generalization performance on undemonstrated states. Hence prove the robot intelligence of autonomous navigation transplanted from limited demonstrations to completely unknown tasks.},
