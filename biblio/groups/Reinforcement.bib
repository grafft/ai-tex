abstract = {Deep Reinforcement Learning has enabled the learning of policies for complex tasks in partially observable environments, without explicitly learning the underlying model of the tasks. While such model-free methods achieve considerable performance, they often ignore the structure of task. We present a natural representation of to Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems using Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs), to better exploit this inherent structure. We define 3 such RCNNs, whose forward passes execute an efficient Value Iteration, propagate beliefs of state in partially observable environments, and choose optimal actions respectively. Backpropagating gradients through these RCNNs allows the system to explicitly learn the Transition Model and Reward Function associated with the underlying MDP, serving as an elegant alternative to classical model-based RL. We evaluate the proposed algorithms in simulation, considering a robot planning problem. We demonstrate the capability of our framework to reduce the cost of replanning, learn accurate MDP models, and finally re-plan with learnt models to achieve near-optimal policies.},

abstract = {We describe an approach to incorporating Bayesian priors in the MAXQ framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We define priors on the primitive environment model and on task pseudo-rewards. Since models for composite tasks can be complex, we use a mixed model-based/model-free learning approach to find an optimal hierarchical policy. We show empirically that (i) our approach results in improved convergence over non-Bayesian baselines, (ii) using both task hierarchies and Bayesian priors is better than either alone, (iii) taking advantage of the task hierarchy reduces the computational cost of Bayesian reinforcement learning and (iv) in this framework, task pseudo-rewards can be learned instead of being manually specified, leading to hierarchically optimal rather than recursively optimal policies.},

abstract = {This paper presents a skill learning model Clarion. Different from existing models of mostly high-level skill learning that use a top-down approach (that is, turning declarative knowledge into procedural knowledge through practice), we adopt a bottom-up approach toward low-level skill learning, where procedural knowledge develops first and declarative knowledge develops later. Our model is formed by integrating connectionist, reinforcement, and symbolic learning methods to perform on-line reactive learning. It adopts a two-level dual-representation framework (Sun, 1995), with a combination of localist and distributed representation. We compare the model with human data in a minefield navigation task, demonstrating some match between the model and human data in several respects. ?? 2001 Cognitive Science Society, Inc.

abstract = {Reinforcement learning has been an important category of machine learning approaches exhibiting self-learning and online learning characteristics. Using reinforcement learning, an agent can learn its behaviors through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment and finally come up with an optimal strategy. Reinforcement learning suffers the curse of dimensionality, though there has been significant progress to overcome this issue in recent years. MAXQ is one of the most common approaches for reinforcement learning. To function properly, MAXQ requires a decomposition of the agent's task into a task hierarchy. Previously, the decomposition can only be done manually. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for automatic subtask discovery. The mechanism applies clustering to automatically construct task hierarchy required by MAXQ, such that MAXQ can be fully automated. We present the design of our mechanism, and demonstrate its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and an extensive experimental evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Duan2016,
abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) has been successful in learning sophis-ticated behaviors automatically; however, the learning process requires a huge number of trials. In contrast, animals can learn new tasks in just a few trials, bene-fiting from their prior knowledge about the world. This paper seeks to bridge this gap. Rather than designing a " fast " reinforcement learning algorithm, we propose to represent it as a recurrent neural network (RNN) and learn it from data. In our proposed method, RL 2 , the algorithm is encoded in the weights of the RNN, which are learned slowly through a general-purpose (" slow ") RL algorithm. The RNN receives all information a typical RL algorithm would receive, including ob-servations, actions, rewards, and termination flags; and it retains its state across episodes in a given Markov Decision Process (MDP). The activations of the RNN store the state of the " fast " RL algorithm on the current (previously unseen) MDP. We evaluate RL 2 experimentally on both small-scale and large-scale problems. On the small-scale side, we train it to solve randomly generated multi-arm bandit problems and finite MDPs. After RL 2 is trained, its performance on new MDPs is close to human-designed algorithms with optimality guarantees. On the large-scale side, we test RL 2 on a vision-based navigation task and show that it scales up to high-dimensional problems.},

@inproceedings{Harutyunyan2017,
abstract = {A temporally abstract action, or an option, is specified by a policy and a termination condition: the policy guides option behavior, and the termination condition roughly determines its length. Generally, learning with longer options (like learning with multi-step returns) is known to be more efficient. However, if the option set for the task is not ideal, and cannot express the primitive optimal policy exactly, shorter options offer more flexibility and can yield a better solution. Thus, the termination condition puts learning efficiency at odds with solution quality. We propose to resolve this dilemma by decoupling the behavior and target terminations, just like it is done with policies in off-policy learning. To this end, we give a new algorithm, Q($\backslash$beta), that learns the solution with respect to any termination condition, regardless of how the options actually terminate. We derive Q($\backslash$beta) by casting learning with options into a common framework with well-studied multi-step off-policy learning. We validate our algorithm empirically, and show that it holds up to its motivating claims.},

abstract = {In recent years deep reinforcement learning (RL) systems have attained superhuman performance in a number of challenging task domains. However, a major limitation of such applications is their demand for massive amounts of training data. A critical present objective is thus to develop deep RL methods that can adapt rapidly to new tasks. In the present work we introduce a novel approach to this challenge, which we refer to as deep meta-reinforcement learning. Previous work has shown that recurrent networks can support meta-learning in a fully supervised context. We extend this approach to the RL setting. What emerges is a system that is trained using one RL algorithm, but whose recurrent dynamics implement a second, quite separate RL procedure. This second, learned RL algorithm can differ from the original one in arbitrary ways. Importantly, because it is learned, it is configured to exploit structure in the training domain. We unpack these points in a series of seven proof-of-concept experiments, each of which examines a key aspect of deep meta-RL. We consider prospects for extending and scaling up the approach, and also point out some potentially important implications for neuroscience.},

abstract = {Designing intelligent and robust autonomous navigation systems remains a great challenge in mobile robotics. Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) offers an efficient learning technique from expert demonstrations to teach robots how to perform specific tasks without manually specifying the reward function. Most of existing IRL algorithms assume the expert policy to be optimal and deterministic, and are applied to experiments with relatively small-size state spaces. However, in autonomous navigation tasks, the state spaces are frequently large and demonstrations can hardly visit all the states. Meanwhile the expert policy may be non-optimal and stochastic. In this paper, we focus on IRL with large-scale and high-dimensional state spaces by introducing the neural network to generalize the expert's behaviors to unvisited regions of the state space and an explicit policy representation is easily expressed by neural network, even for the stochastic expert policy. An efficient and convenient algorithm, Neural Inverse Reinforcement Learning (NIRL), is proposed. Experimental results on simulated autonomous navigation tasks show that a mobile robot using our approach can successfully navigate to the target position without colliding with unpredicted obstacles, largely reduce the learning time, and has a good generalization performance on undemonstrated states. Hence prove the robot intelligence of autonomous navigation transplanted from limited demonstrations to completely unknown tasks.},

To this end, we develop a method that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations directly to torques at the robot's motors. The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. We evaluate our method on a range of real-world manipulation tasks that require close coordination between vision and control, such as screwing a cap onto a bottle, and present simulated comparisons to a range of prior policy search methods.},

abstract = {Abstract. Temporally extended actions are usually effective in speeding up reinforcement learning. In this paper we present a mechanism for automatically constructing such actions, expressed as options [Sutton et al., 1999], in a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP). To do this, we compute a bisimulation metric [Ferns et al., 2004] between the states in a small MDP and the states in a large MDP, which we want to solve. The shape of this metric is then used to completely define a set of options for the large MDP. We demonstrate empirically that our approach is able to improve the speed of reinforcement learning, and is generally not sensitive to parameter tuning.},

abstract = {Pulse Coupled Neural Network (PCNN) is suitable for dealing with the classical shortest path problem, because of its autowave characteristic. However, most methods suggest that the autowave of PCNN models should keep a constant speed in finding the shortest paths. This paper proposes a novel self-adaptive autowave pulse-coupled neural network (SAPCNN) model for the shortest path problem. The autowave generated by SAPCNN propagates adaptively according to the current network state, which guarantees it spreads more effectively in finding the shortest paths. Our experiments, which have been carried out for both the shortest paths problem and K shortest paths problem, show that our proposed algorithm outperforms classical algorithms. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The behavior includes effects of differential probabilities, magnitudes, variabilities, and delay of reinforcement. The model can also produce the violation of independence, preference reversals, and the goal gradient of reinforcement in maze learning. An experiment was conducted to study learning of action sequences in a multistep task. The fit of the model to the data demonstrated its ability to account for complex skill learning.

Both the historical basis of the field and a broad selection of current work are summarized. Reinforcement learning is the problem faced by an agent that learns behavior through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment. The work described here has a resemblance to work in psychology, but differs considerably in the details and in the use of the word ``reinforcement.'' The paper discusses central issues of reinforcement learning, including trading off exploration and exploitation, establishing the foundations of the field via Markov decision theory, learning from delayed reinforcement, constructing empirical models to accelerate learning, making use of generalization and hierarchy, and coping with hidden state. It concludes with a survey of some implemented systems and an assessment of the practical utility of current methods for reinforcement learning.},

Yet, what intrinsic motivation may mean computationally, and how it may differ from extrinsic motivation, remains a murky and controversial subject. In this paper, we adopt an evolutionary perspective and define a new optimal reward framework that captures the pressure to design good primary reward functions that lead to evolutionary success across environments. The results of two computational experiments show that optimal primary reward signals may yield both emergent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The evolutionary perspective and the associated optimal reward framework thus lead to the conclusion that there are no hard and fast features distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic reward computationally. Rather, the directness of the relationship between rewarding behavior and evolutionary success varies along a continuum.},

A major challenge in this setting, both for neural network approaches and classical planning, is the need to explore future worlds of a complex and interactive environment. To this end, we integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search with hierarchical neural net control policies trained on expressive LTL specifications. This paper investigates the ability of neural networks to learn both LTL constraints and control policies in order to generate task plans in complex environments.

We show that Q-learning converges to the optimum action-values with probability 1 so long as all actions are repeatedly sampled in all states and the action-values are represented discretely. We also sketch extensions to the cases of non-discounted, but absorbing, Markov environments, and where many Q values can be changed each iteration, rather than just one.},

abstract = {We present Project Malmo – an AI experimenta-tion platform built on top of the popular computer game Minecraft, and designed to support funda-mental research in artificial intelligence. As the AI research community pushes for artificial gen-eral intelligence (AGI), experimentation platforms are needed that support the development of flexible agents that learn to solve diverse tasks in complex environments. Minecraft is an ideal foundation for such a platform, as it exposes agents to complex 3D worlds, coupled with infinitely varied game-play. Project Malmo provides a sophisticated abstraction layer on top of Minecraft that supports a wide range of experimentation scenarios, ranging from navi-gation and survival to collaboration and problem solving tasks. In this demo we present the Malmo platform and its capabilities. The platform is pub-licly released as open source software at IJCAI, to support openness and collaboration in AI research.},

@article{Mnih2015,
abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account 1 , deeply rooted in psychological 2 and neuroscientific 3 perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory pro-cessing systems 4,5 , the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopa-minergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms 3 . While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains 6–8 , their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks 9–11 to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games 12},

A map of the environment is generated on-line by the learning agent, representing the topological structure of the state transitions.

Policies for reaching the different parts of the space are separately learned and added to the model in a form of options (macro-actions). The options are used for accelerating the Q-Learning algorithm. We extend the basic algorithm and consider building a map that includes preliminary indication of the location of "interesting" regions of the state space, where the value gradient is significant and additional exploration might be beneficial.

abstract = {Tasks that require many sequential decisions are hard to solve using conventional rein- forcement learning algorithms. Based on the option framework, we propose a model which aims to alleviate these concerns. Instead of learning a single monolithic policy, the agent learns a set of simpler sub-policies as well as the initiation and termination probabili- ties for each of those sub-policies. While ex- isting option learning algorithms frequently require manual specification of components such as the sub-policies, we present an algo- rithm which infers all relevant components of the option framework from data. We present results on SMDPs with discrete as well as continuous state-action spaces. The results show that the presented algorithm can combine simple sub-policies to solve complex tasks and can improve learning performance on simpler tasks.},

Currently, deep learning is enabling reinforcement learning to scale to problems that were previously intractable, such as learning to play video games directly from pixels. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are also applied to robotics, allowing control policies for robots to be learned directly from camera inputs in the real world. In this survey, we begin with an introduction to the general field of reinforcement learning, then progress to the main streams of value-based and policy-based methods. Our survey will cover central algorithms in deep reinforcement learning, including the deep {\$}Q{\$}-network, trust region policy optimisation, and asynchronous advantage actor-critic. In parallel, we highlight the unique advantages of deep neural networks, focusing on visual understanding via reinforcement learning. To conclude, we describe several current areas of research within the field.},
