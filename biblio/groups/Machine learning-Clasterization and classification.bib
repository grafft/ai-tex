abstract = {Automatic categorization of documents into pre-defined topic hierarchies or taxonomies is a crucial step in knowledge and content management. Standard machine learning techniques like support vector machines and related large margin methods have been successfully applied for this task, albeit the fact is that they ignore the inter-class relationships. Unfortunately, in the context of document categorization, we face a large number of classes and a huge number of relevant features needed to distinguish between them. The computational cost of training a classifier for a problem of this size is prohibitive. It has also been observed that obtaining a classifier that discriminates between two groups of classes is much easier than distinguishing simultaneously among all classes. This has prompted substantial research in using hierarchical classifiers to address single multi-class problems. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical classification method that generalizes support vector machine learning that is based on the results of support vector clustering method, and are structured in a way that mirrors the class hierarchy. Compared to previous non-hierarchical SVM classifier and famous documents categorization systems, the proposed hierarchical SVM classification has a better improvement in classification accuracy in the standard Reuters corpus.},

abstract = {In this paper, the support vector clustering is ex- tended to an adaptive cell growing model which maps data points to a high dimensional feature space through a desired kernel function. This generalized model is called multiple spheres sup- port vector clustering, which essentially identifies dense regions in the original space by finding their corresponding spheres with minimal radius in the feature space. A multisphere clustering algorithm based on adaptive cluster cell growing method is devel- oped, whereby it is possible to obtain the grade of memberships, as well as cluster prototypes in partition. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated for the problem of arbitrary cluster shapes and for prototype identification in an actual application to a handwritten digit data set.},
