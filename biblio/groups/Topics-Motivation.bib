@article{Kaplan2004,
abstract = {This chapter presents a generic internal reward system that drives an agent to increase the complexity of its behavior. This reward system does not reinforce a predefined task. Its purpose is to drive the agent to progress in learning given its embodiment and the environment in which it is placed. The dynamics created by such a system are studied first in a simple environment and then in the context of active vision.},

@article{Kurup2011,
abstract = {Generating future states of the world is an essential component of high level cognitive tasks such as planning. We explore the notion that such future state generation is more widespread and forms an integral part of cognition. We call these generated states expectations, and propose that cognitive systems constantly generate expectations, match them to observed behavior and react when a difference exists between the two. We describe an ACT R model that performs expectation driven cognition on two tasks pedestrian tracking and behavior classification. The model generates expectations of pedestrian movements to track them. The model also uses differences in expectations to identify distinctive features that differentiate these tracks. During learning, the model learns the association between these features and the various behaviors. During testing, it classifies pedestrian tracks by recalling the behavior associated with the features of each track. We tested the model on both single and multiple behavior datasets and compared the results against a k NN classifier. The k NN classifier outperformed the model in correct classifications, but the model had fewer incorrect classifications in the multiple behavior case, and both systems had about equal incorrect classifications in the single behavior case},

@article{Hawes2011,
abstract = {The ability to achieve ones goals is a defining characteristic of intelligent behaviour. A great many existing theories, systems and research programmes address the problems associated with generating behaviour to achieve a goal; much fewer address the related problems of how and why goals should be generated in an intelligent artifact, and how a subset of all possible goals are selected as the focus of behaviour. It is research into these problems of motivation, which this article aims to stimulate. Building from the analysis of a scenario involving a futuristic household robot, we extend an existing account of motivation in intelligent systems to provide a framework for surveying relevant literature in AI and robotics. This framework guides us to look at the problems of encoding drives (how the needs of the system are represented), goal generation (how particular instances of goals are generated from the drives with reference to the current state), and goal selection (how the system determines which goal instances to act on). After surveying a variety of existing approaches in these terms, we build on the results of the survey to sketch a design for a new motive management framework which goes beyond the current state of the art. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Singh2010a,
abstract = {There is great interest in building intrinsic motivation into artificial systems using the reinforcement learning framework. Yet, what intrinsic motivation may mean computationally, and how it may differ from extrinsic motivation, remains a murky and controversial subject. In this paper, we adopt an evolutionary perspective and define a new optimal reward framework that captures the pressure to design good primary reward functions that lead to evolutionary success across environments. The results of two computational experiments show that optimal primary reward signals may yield both emergent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The evolutionary perspective and the associated optimal reward framework thus lead to the conclusion that there are no hard and fast features distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic reward computationally. Rather, the directness of the relationship between rewarding behavior and evolutionary success varies along a continuum.},
