abstract = {We develop a new oscillatory model that combines consecutive selection of objects and discrimination between new and familiar objects. The model works with visual information and fulfils the following operations: (1) separation of different objects according to their spatial connectivity; (2) consecutive selection of objects located in the visual field into the attention focus; (3) extraction of features; (4) representation of objects in working memory; (5) novelty detection of objects. The functioning of the model is based on two main principles: the synchronization of oscillators through phase-locking and resonant increase of the amplitudes of oscillators if they work in-phase with other oscillators. The results of computer simulation of the model are described for visual stimuli representing printed words.},

abstract = {Selective visual attention is believed to be responsible for serializing visual information for recognizing one object at a time in a complex scene. But how can we attend to objects before they are recognized? In coherence theory of visual cognition, so-called proto-objects form volatile units of visual information that can be accessed by selective attention and subsequently validated as actual objects. We propose a biologically plausible model of forming and attending to proto-objects in natural scenes. We demonstrate that the suggested model can enable a model of object recognition in cortex to expand from recognizing individual objects in isolation to sequentially recognizing all objects in a more complex scene.},

The model is built entirely on computational constraints but nevertheless results in an architecture with cells and connectivity reminiscent of that appearing in the visual cortex. It is demonstrated that a variety of visual search behaviors appear as emergent properties of the model and therefore basic principles of coding and information transmission.

abstract = {Now that the study of consciousness is warmly embraced by cognitive scientists, much confusion seems to arise between the concepts of visual attention and visual awareness. Often, visual awareness is equated to what is in the focus of attention. There are, however, two sets of arguments to separate attention from awareness: a psychological/theoretical one and a neurobiological one. By combining these arguments I present definitions of visual attention and awareness that clearly distinguish between the two, yet explain why attention and awareness are so intricately related. In fact, there seems more overlap between mechanisms of memory and awareness than between those of attention and awareness.},

abstract = {Human awareness under different circumstances is complex and non-trivial to understand. Nevertheless, due to the importance of awareness for safety and efficiency in many domains (e.g., the aviation domain), it is necessary to study the processes behind situation awareness, to eliminate possible errors in action selection that may lead to disasters. Interesting models for situation awareness have been presented, mainly from an ecological psychology perspective, but they are debatable with respect to the latest neurocognitive evidences. With the developments in brain imaging and recording techniques, more and more detailed information on complex cognitive processes becomes available. This provides room to further investigate the mechanisms behind many cognitive phenomena, including situation awareness. This paper presents a computational cognitive agent model for situation awareness from the perspective of action selection, which is inspired by neurocognitive evidences. The model integrates bottom-up and top-down cognitive processes, related to various cognitive states: perception, desires, attention, intention, (prior and retrospective) awareness, ownership, feeling, and communication. Based on the model, various cognitive effects can be explained, such as perceptual load, predictive processes, inferential processes, cognitive controlling, unconscious bias, and conscious bias. A model like this will be useful in domains that benefit from complex simulations of socio-technical systems (e.g. the aviation domain) based on computational models of human behaviour. In such domains, existing agent-based simulations are limited, since most of the agent models do not include realistic nature-inspired processes. The validity of the model is illustrated based on simulations for the aviation domain, focusing on a particular situation where an agent has biased perception, poor comprehension, habitual driven projection, and conflict between prior and retrospective effects on action execution.},

abstract = {Understanding consciousness is one of the most fasci- nating challenges of our time. Fromancient civilizations to modern philosophers, questions have been asked on howone is conscious of his/her own existence and about theworld that surrounds him/her. Although there is no precise definition for consciousness, there is an agreement that it is strongly related to human cognitive pro- cesses such as attention, a process capable of promoting a selection of a few stimuli from a huge amount of information that reaches us constantly. In order to bring the consciousness discussion to a com- putational scenario, this paper presents conscious attention-based integrated model (CONAIM), a formal model for machine con- sciousness based on an attentional schema for human-like agent cognition that integrates: short- and long-term memories, rea- soning, planning, emotion, decision-making, learning, motivation, and volition. Experimental results in a mobile robotics domain show that the agent can attentively use motivation, volition, and memories to set its goals and learn new concepts and procedures based on exogenous and endogenous stimuli. By performing com- putation over an attentional space, the model also allowed the agent to learn over a much reduced state space. Further imple- mentation under this model could potentially allow the agent to express sentience, self-awareness, self-consciousness, autonoetic consciousness, mineness, and perspectivalness.},

We refer to these mechanisms as "attention." Attention acts by increasing the strength of selected neural representations and preferentially routing them through the brain's large-scale network. This is a critical component of cognition and therefore has been a central topic in cognitive neuroscience. Here we review a diverse literature that has studied attention at the level of behavior, networks, circuits, and neurons. We then integrate these disparate results into a unified theory of attention.},

Many different models of attention are now available which, aside from lending theoretical contributions to other fields, have demonstrated successful applications in computer vision, mobile robotics, and cognitive systems. Here we review, from a computational perspective, the basic concepts of attention implemented in these models. We present a taxonomy of nearly 65 models, which provides a critical comparison of approaches, their capabilities, and shortcomings. In particular, 13 criteria derived from behavioral and computational studies are formulated for qualitative comparison of attention models. Furthermore, we address several challenging issues with models, including biological plausibility of the computations, correlation with eye movement datasets, bottom-up and top-down dissociation, and constructing meaningful performance measures. Finally, we highlight current research trends in attention modeling and provide insights for future.},

abstract = {A biologically motivated computational model of bottom-up visual selective attention was used to examine the degree to which stimulus salience guides the allocation of attention. Human eye movements were recorded while participants viewed a series of digitized images of complex natural and artificial scenes. Stimulus dependence of attention, as measured by the correlation between computed stimulus salience and fixation locations, was found to be significantly greater than that expected by chance alone and furthermore was greatest for eye movements that immediately follow stimulus onset. The ability to guide attention of three modeled stimulus features (color, intensity and orientation) was examined and found to vary with image type. Additionally, the effect of the drop in visual sensitivity as a function of eccentricity on stimulus salience was examined, modeled, and shown to be an important determiner of attentional allocation. Overall, the results indicate that stimulus-driven, bottom-up mechanisms contribute significantly to attentional guidance under natural viewing conditions.},

@article{Schneider1999,
abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how visual-spatial working memory, attention, and scene representation are related. The first section introduces a modified two-stage conception of visual-spatial processing. "Stage one" refers to low-level visual-spatial processing and computes in parallel for the currently available retinal information "object candidates," here called "visual-spatial units." An attentional process called "unit selection" allows access to stage two for one of these units at a time. Stage two contains high-level visual-spatial information that can be used for goal-directions (e.g., verbal report, grasping). It consists of three parallel processing streams. First, the currently selected unit is recognized; second, a spatial-motor program for the selected unit is computed; and third, an "object file" is set up for the selected unit. An object file contains temporary episodic representations of detailed high-level visual-spatial attributes of an "object" plus an "index." An index acts as a pointer and is bound via temporary connections to the attributes of the file. Section two of this paper specifies one part of stage two in more detail, namely visual-spatial working memory (VSWM). It can contain up to four object files. A first central claim is that during sensory-based processing for working memory ("access"), one object file is always "on-line," and up to three other object files are "off-line". A second central claim is that the process of setting up an object file depends on the number and the activation level of already stored files. Based on the concept of activation-based competition between object files, it is postulated that the more files that are stored and the higher their activation is, the longer it takes for a newly set up object file to reach a sufficient level of activation. Activation-based competition is also used to explain "short-term forgetting" by "interference." A third central claim about VSWM is that a "refreshment" process exists that increases the activation level of an index of an object file in order to prevent forgetting or in order to bring the file back to the state of controlling the current action. Finally, section three gives a selective look at a number of experimental data such as the attentional blink, backward masking, dwell time effects, transsaccadic memory, and change blindness. New explanations are offered and new predictions made.},

We review recent developments on this topic that have emerged from the traditionally separate fields of machine learning, eye movements in natural behavior, and studies of curiosity in psychology and neuroscience. These studies show that exploration may be guided by a family of mechanisms that range from automatic biases toward novelty or surprise to systematic searches for learning progress and information gain in curiosity-driven behavior. In addition, eye movements reflect visual information searching in multiple conditions and are amenable for cellular-level investigations. This suggests that the oculomotor system is an excellent model system for understanding information-sampling mechanisms. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {We propose a computational model for the task-specific guidance of visual attention in real-world scenes. Our model emphasizes four aspects that are important in biological vision: determining task-relevance of an entity, biasing attention for the low-level visual features of desired targets, recognizing these targets using the same low-level features, and incrementally building a visual map of task-relevance at every scene location. Given a task definition in the form of keywords, the model first determines and stores the task-relevant entities in working memory, using prior knowledge stored in long-term memory. It attempts to detect the most relevant entity by biasing its visual attention system with the entity's learned low-level features. It attends to the most salient location in the scene, and attempts to recognize the attended object through hierarchical matching against object representations stored in long-term memory. It updates its working memory with the task-relevance of the recognized entity and updates a topographic task-relevance map with the location and relevance of the recognized entity. The model is tested on three types of tasks: single-target detection in 343 natural and synthetic images, where biasing for the target accelerates target detection over twofold on average; sequential multiple-target detection in 28 natural images, where biasing, recognition, working memory and long term memory contribute to rapidly finding all targets; and learning a map of likely locations of cars from a video clip filmed while driving on a highway. The model's performance on search for single features and feature conjunctions is consistent with existing psychophysical data. These results of our biologically-motivated architecture suggest that the model may provide a reasonable approximation to many brain processes involved in complex task-driven visual behaviors.},

abstract = {Five important trends have emerged from recent work on computational models of focal visual attention that emphasize the bottom-up, image-based control of attentional deployment. First, the perceptual saliency of stimuli critically depends on the surrounding context. Second, a unique 'saliency map' that topographically encodes for stimulus conspicuity over the visual scene has proved to be an efficient and plausible bottom-up control strategy. Third, inhibition of return, the process by which the currently attended location is prevented from being attended again, is a crucial element of attentional deployment. Fourth, attention and eye movements tightly interplay, posing computational challenges with respect to the coordinate system used to control attention. And last, scene understanding and object recognition strongly constrain the selection of attended locations. Insights from these five key areas provide a framework for a computational and neurobiological understanding of visual attention.},
