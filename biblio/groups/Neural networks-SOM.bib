abstract = {This study aims to develop a generalized framework of an SOM called a modular network SOM (mnSOM). The mnSOM has an array structure consisting of functional modules that are trainable neural networks, e.g., multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), instead of the vector units of the conventional SOM. In the case of MLP-modules, an mnSOM learns a group of systems or functions in terms of the input-output relationships in parallel with generating a feature map of them. Thus an mnSOM with MLP modules is an SOM in function space rather than in vector space. In this paper, first, as an example, we focus on a class of mnSOM that consists of MLP modules and introduce the architecture and algorithm. Then, a more generalized framework is described. Finally, some simulation results of an MLP-module-mnSOM are presented. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Tino2006,
abstract = {Recently there has been an outburst of interest in extending topographic maps of vectorial data to more general data structures, such as sequences or trees. However, there is no general consensus as to how best to process sequences using topographic maps, and this topic remains an active focus of neurocomputational research. The representational capabilities and internal representations of the models are not well understood. Here, we rigorously analyze a generalization of the self-organizing map (SOM) for processing sequential data, recursive SOM(RecSOM) (Voegtlin, 2002), as a nonautonomous dynamical system consisting of a set of fixed input maps. We argue that contractive fixed-input maps are likely to produce Markovian organizations of receptive fields on the RecSOM map. We derive bounds on parameter beta (weighting the importance of importing past information when processing sequences) under which contractiveness of the fixed-input maps is guaranteed. Some generalizations of SOM contain a dynamic module responsible for processing temporal contexts as an integral part of the model. We show that Markovian topographic maps of sequential data can be produced using a simple fixed (nonadaptable) dynamic module externally feeding a standard topographic model designed to process static vectorial data of fixed dimensionality (e.g., SOM). However, by allowing trainable feedback connections, one can obtain Markovian maps with superior memory depth and topography preservation. We elaborate on the importance of non-Markovian organizations in topographic maps of sequential data.},

abstract = {We present an approach for abstracting invariant classifications of spatiotemporal patterns presented in a highdimensionality input stream, and apply an early proof-of-concept to shift and scale invariant shape recognition. A model called Hierarchical Quilted Self-Organizing Map (HQSOM) is developed, using recurrent self-organizing maps (RSOM) arranged in a pyramidal hierarchy, attempting to mimic the parallel/hierarchical pattern of isocortical processing in the brain. The results of experiments are presented in which the algorithm learns to classify multiple shapes, invariant to shift and scale transformations, in a very small (7×7 pixel) field of view.},

@article{Voegtlin2002a,
abstract = {This paper explores the combination of self-organizing map (SOM) and feedback, in order to represent sequences of inputs. In general, neural networks with time-delayed feedback represent time implicitly, by combining current inputs and past activities. It has been difficult to apply this approach to SOM, because feedback generates instability during learning. We demonstrate a solution to this problem, based on a nonlinearity. The result is a generalization of SOM that learns to represent sequences recursively. We demonstrate that the resulting representations are adapted to the temporal statistics of the input series. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},
