@article{Crosby2014,
abstract = {In this paper we present a novel approach to multiagent planning in domains with concurrent actions and associated concurrent action constraints. In these domains, we associate the actions of individual agents with subsets of objects, which allows for a transformation of the problems into single-agent planning problems that are considerably easier to solve. The transformation forces agents to select joint actions associated with a single subset of objects at a time, and ensures that the concurrency constraints on this subset are satisfied. Joint actions are serialised such that each agent performs their part of the action separately. The number of actions in the resulting single-agent planning problem turns out to be manageable in many real-world domains, thus allowing the problem to be solved efficiently using a standard single-agent planner. We also describe a cost-optimal algorithm for compressing the resulting plan, i.e. merging individual actions in order to reduce the total number of joint actions. Results show that our approach can handle large problems that are impossible to solve for most multiagent planners.},

abstract = {To engage diverse agents in cooperative behavior, it is important, even necessary, to provide algo- rithms that do not reveal information that is private or proprietary. A number of recent planning algo- rithms enable agents to plan together for shared goals without disclosing information about their private state and actions. But these algorithms lack clear and formal privacy guarantees: the fact that they do not require agents to explicitly reveal pri- vate information, does not imply that such informa- tion cannot be deduced. The main contribution of this paper is an enhanced version of the distributed forward-search planning framework of Nissim and Brafman that reveals less information than the orig- inal algorithm, and the first, to our knowledge, dis- cussion and formal proof of privacy guarantees for distributed planning and search algorithms.},

@article{Jennings1995,
abstract = {One reason why Distributed AI (DAI) technology has been deployed in relatively few real-size applications is that it lacks a clear and implementable model of cooperative problem solving which specifies how agents should operate and interact in complex, dynamic and unpredictable environments. As a consequence of the experience gained whilst building a number of DAI systems for industrial applications, a new principled model of cooperation has been developed. This model, called Joint Responsibility, has the notion of joint intentions at its core. It specifies pre-conditions which must be attained before collaboration can commence and prescribes how individuals should behave both when joint activity is progressing satisfactorily and also when it runs into difficulty. The theoretical model has been used to guide the implementation of a general-purpose cooperation framework and the qualitative and quantitative benefits of this implementation have been assessed through a series of comparative experiments in the real-world domain of electricity transportation management. Finally, the success of the approach of building a system with an explicit and grounded representation of cooperative problem solving is used to outline a proposal for the next generation of multi-agent systems.},

abstract = {Agent teaming and autonomy are foundational themes in multi-agent systems. Agents may work as singletons or they may work in environments where other agents exist. In multi-agent systems, agents may form teams by sharing common goals with other agents. Cooperation is essential for any collaborative, group activity. Beyond coordination and judicious role assignment, cooperation enables members of a team to be aware and account for collection of their goals as well as the performance of agents on individual goals. This paper presents a general model of cooperation and illustrates how it may enhance group performance. In this paper, we present results of an application of the concept of cooperation in a simulated swarm of reconnaissance urban UAVs that are tracking vehicles in an urban environment.},

In this work we detail a novel type of Hierarchical Task Network we call a Clique/Chain HTN (CC-HTN), alongside an algorithm for autonomously constructing them from topological properties derived from graphical task representations. As the presented method relies on the structure of the task itself, our work imposes no particular type of symbolic insight into motor primitives or environmental representation, making it applicable to a wide variety of use cases critical to human-robot interaction. We present evaluations within a multi-resolution goal inference task and a transfer learning application showing the utility of our approach.},

These high-level abilities depend on reliable navigation and perception of the environment. We present cognitively plausible agents used for training in virtual simulations of Military Operations on Urban Terrain (MOUT). These cognitive agents are developed using the ACT-R cognitive architecture, an architecture used to model human performance in a wide variety of psychological experiments. These agents use their real-time perceptions to shape their interactions with other agents and human players on both the friendly and opposing sides of the conflict. Planning is accomplished on-line by combining schematic plans with the current context, resulting in flexible and appropriate action. Roles within plans are negotiated between agents on an as-needed basis while plans are selected based on the availability of other agents. 1},

abstract = {When robots work alongside humans for performing collaborative tasks, they need to be able to anticipate human's future actions and plan appropriate actions. The tasks we consider are performed in contextually-rich environments containing objects, and there is a large variation in the way humans perform these tasks. We use a graphical model to represent the state-space, where we model the humans through their low-level kinematics as well as their high-level intent, and model their interactions with the objects through physically-grounded object affordances. This allows our model to anticipate a belief about possible future human actions, and we model the human's and robot's behavior through an MDP in this rich state- space. We further discuss that due to perception errors and the limitations of the model, the human may not take the optimal action and therefore we present robot's anticipatory planning with different behaviors of thehumanwithin themodel's scope. In experiments onCornellActivity Dataset, we showthat our method performs better than various baselines for collaborative planning.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 The Author(s)In many cases several entities, such as commercial companies, need to work together towards the achievement of joint goals, while hiding certain private information. To collaborate effectively, some sort of plan is needed to coordinate the different entities. We address the problem of automatically generating such a coordination plan while preserving the agents' privacy. Maintaining privacy is challenging when planning for multiple agents, especially when tight collaboration is needed and a global high-level view of the plan is required. In this work we present the Greedy Privacy-Preserving Planner (GPPP), a privacy preserving planning algorithm in which the agents collaboratively generate an abstract and approximate global coordination plan and then individually extend the global plan to executable plans. To guide GPPP, we propose two domain independent privacy preserving heuristics based on landmarks and pattern databases, which are classical heuristics for single agent search. These heuristics, called privacy-preserving landmarks and privacy preserving PDBs, are agnostic to the planning algorithm and can be used by other privacy-preserving planning algorithms. Empirically, we demonstrate on benchmark domains the benefits of using these heuristics and the advantage of GPPP over existing privacy preserving planners for the multi-agent STRIPS formalism.},
