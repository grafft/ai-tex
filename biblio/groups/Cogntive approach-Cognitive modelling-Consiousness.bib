abstract = {‘Working memory' refers to the capacity-constrained active memory in which information is temporarily maintained and concurrently processed for the use in an ongoing goal-directed activity. The neural mechanisms responsible for con- sciousness are located in certain brain regions, such as the DLPFC, PPC TPJ and ACC, and these brain regions are coupled with a network that includes the central executive of working memory. In this chapter, we explore the nature of the neural basis of working memory and try to explain the mechanisms of working memory. In order to understand the neural basis of active consciousness, we also investigate how information is controlled by the neural basis of working memory. We use reading span test (RST), which measures the working memory capacity to memo- rize the target words of sentences during reading, to measure individual differences in working memory capacity.},

@article{Paraense2016,
abstract = {In this work, we present a distributed cognitive architecture used to control the traffic in an urban network. This architecture relies on a machine consciousness approach – Global Work- space Theory – in order to use competition and broadcast, allowing a group of local traffic con- trollers to interact, resulting in a better group performance. The main idea is that the local controllers usually perform a purely reactive behavior, defining the times of red and green lights, according just to local information. These local controllers compete in order to define which of them is experiencing the most critical traffic situation. The controller in the worst condition gains access to the global workspace, further broadcasting its condition (and its loca- tion) to all other controllers, asking for their help in dealing with its situation. This call from the controller accessing the global workspace will cause an interference in the reactive local behavior, for those local controllers with some chance in helping the controller in a critical con- dition, by containing traffic in its direction. This group behavior, coordinated by the global workspace strategy, turns the once reactive behavior into a kind of deliberative one. We show that this strategy is capable of improving the overall mean travel time of vehicles flowing through the urban network. A consistent gain in performance with the ‘‘Artificial Consciousness” traffic signal controller during all simulation time, throughout different simulated scenarios, could be observed, ranging from around 13.8{\%} to more than 21{\%}.},

@article{Baars2005a,
abstract = {Global workspace (GW) theory emerged from the cognitive architecture tradition in cognitive science. Newell and co-workers were the first to show the utility of a GW or "blackboard" architecture in a distributed set of knowledge sources, which could cooperatively solve problems that no single constituent could solve alone. The empirical connection with conscious cognition was made by Baars (1988, 2002). GW theory generates explicit predictions for conscious aspects of perception, emotion, motivation, learning, working memory, voluntary control, and self systems in the brain. It has similarities to biological theories such as Neural Darwinism and dynamical theories of brain functioning. Functional brain imaging now shows that conscious cognition is distinctively associated with wide spread of cortical activity, notably toward frontoparietal and medial temporal regions. Unconscious comparison conditions tend to activate only local regions, such as visual projection areas. Frontoparietal hypometabolism is also implicated in unconscious states, including deep sleep, coma, vegetative states, epileptic loss of consciousness, and general anesthesia. These findings are consistent with the GW hypothesis, which is now favored by a number of scientists and philosophers.},
