abstract = {A central problem in multistrategy learning systems is the selection and sequencing of machine learning algorithms for particular situations. This is typically done by the system designer who analyzes the learning task and implements the appropriate algorithm or sequence of algorithms for that task. A solution to this problem is proposed to enable an AI system with a library of machine learning algorithms to select and sequence appropriate algorithms autonomously.},

@article{Khardon1999,
abstract = {We introduce a new framework for the study of reasoning. The Learning (in order) to Reason approach developed here views learning as an integral part of the inference process, and suggests that learning and reasoning should be studied together. The Learning to Reason framework combines the interfaces to the world used by known learning models with the reasoning task and a performance criterion suitable for it. In this framework, the intelligent agent is given access to its favorite learning interface, and is also given a grace period in which it can interact with this interface and construct a representation KB of the world W. The reasoning performance is measured only after this period, when the agent is presented with queries a from some query language, relevant to the world, and has to answer whether W implies a. The approach is meant to overcome the main computational difficulties in the traditional treatment of reasoning which stem from its separation from the “world”. Since the agent interacts with the world when constructing its knowledge representation it can choose a representation that is useful for the task at hand. Moreover, we can now make explicit the dependence of the reasoning performance on the environment the agent interacts with. We show how previous results from learning theory and reasoning fit into this framework and illustrate the usefulness of the Learning to Reason approach by exhibiting new results that are not possible in the traditional setting. First, we give Learning to Reason algorithms for classes of propositional languages for which there are no efficient reasoning algorithms, when represented as a traditional (formula-based) knowledge base. Second, we exhibit a Learning to Reason algorithm for a class of propositional languages that is not known to be learnable in the traditional sense.},

abstract = {The papers in the first part shed some light on the concept of reflection or its origins. Important questions treated in these papers are: What are the issues in computational reflection. How does it relate to the notion of reflection in logic and meta-mathematics. How can reflective systems be categorized. Why is meaning an important issue in reflection and reflection an interesting domain to study meaning. A number of practical realisations of reflective systems are presented in the second part. The papers investigate the problems arising in the construction of reflective systems, and present techniques to solve these. The implementations range from specific systems exhibiting a reflective behaviour e.g. logic-based reasoning system, rule-based systems, etc., to programming languages providing facilities for the construction of reflective systems (logic programming languages, description-based languages, functional languages, object-oriented and actor languages). Finally, various applications of meta-level architectures and reflection are described.},

abstract = {The capacity to think about our own thinking may lie at the heart of what it means to be both human and intelligent. Philosophers and cognitive scientists have investigated these matters for many years. Researchers in artificial intelligence have gone further, attempting to implement actual machines that mimic, simulate, and perhaps even replicate this capacity, called metareasoning. In this volume, leading authorities offer a variety of perspectives--drawn from philosophy, cognitive psychology, and computer science--on reasoning about the reasoning process. The book offers a simple model of reasoning about reason as a framework for its discussions. Following this framework, the contributors consider metalevel control of computational activities, introspective monitoring, distributed metareasoning, and, putting all these aspects of metareasoning together, models of the self. Taken together, the chapters offer an integrated narrative on metareasoning themes from both artificial intelligence and cognitive science perspectives.},
