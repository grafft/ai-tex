@article{Touretzky1985,
abstract = {Pattern matching and variable binding are easily implemented in conventional computer architectures, but not necessarily in all architectures. In a distributed neural network architecture each symbol is represented by activity in many units and each unit contributes to the representation of many symbols. Manipulating symbols using this type of distributed representation is not as easy as with a local representation whore each unit denotes one symbol, but there is evidence that the distributed approach is the one chosen by nature. We describe a working implementation of a production system interpreter in a neural network using distributed representations for both symbols and rules. The research provides a detailed account of two important symbolic reasoning operations, pattern matching and variable binding, as emergent properties of collections of neuron-like elements. The success of our production system implementation goes some way towards answering a common criticism of connectionist theories: that they aren't powerful enough to do symbolic reasoning.},

@article{Garcez2015,
abstract = {The goal of neural-symbolic computation is to integrate ro- bust connectionist learning and sound symbolic reasoning. With the recent advances in connectionist learning, in par- ticular deep neural networks, forms of representation learn- ing have emerged. However, such representations have not become useful for reasoning. Results from neural-symbolic computation have shown to offer powerful alternatives for knowledge representation, learning and reasoning in neural computation. This paper recalls the main contributions and discusses key challenges for neural-symbolic integration which have been identified at a recent Dagstuhl seminar.},
