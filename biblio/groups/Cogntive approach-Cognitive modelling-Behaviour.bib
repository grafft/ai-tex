abstract = {The hierarchical structure of human and animal behavior has been of critical interest in neuroscience for many years. Yet understanding the neural processes that give rise to such structure remains an open challenge. In recent research, a new perspective on hierarchical behavior has begun to take shape, inspired by ideas from machine learning, and in particular the framework of hierarchical reinforcement learning. Hierarchical reinforcement learning builds on traditional reinforcement learning mechanisms, extending them to accommodate temporally extended behaviors or subroutines. The resulting computational paradigm has begun to influence both theoretical and empirical work in neuroscience, conceptually aligning the study of hierarchical behavior with research on other aspects of learning and decision making, and giving rise to some thought-provoking new findings. ?? 2012.},

abstract = {A key capability that distinguishes humans from intelligent agents is the ability to generate and select new goals in an unexpected situation, while re-prioritizing existing goals. This level of cognitive autonomy becomes practically vital for actors working as team members with humans or in unpredictable environments. The work is focused on a new perspective on this problem based on biologically inspired cognitive architectures (BICA). Aspects of goal reasoning and goal management capabilities that are currently available in selected BICA are reviewed. A generalizing model of goal reasoning as a form of metacognition is defined, that integrates multiple mechanisms. On top of the traditional cognitive cycle, the model includes a goal-reasoning cycle triggered by notable phenomena. This goal reasoning cycle integrates mechanisms like agitation of desires by drives and their instantiation in goals, or metacognitive reasoning about goals. The model is illustrated by consideration of specific scenarios at micro- and macro-cognitive scales to evaluate the use and potential capabilities of this goal reasoning model for BICA. New capabilities that will be enabled based on this approach are expected to increase the human compatibility and cognitive autonomy of future intelligent agents. The general goal reasoning capability is a key component included in the BICA Challenge and is required for integration of intelligent agents into human teams.},

@article{Raghubir2006,
abstract = {This paper examines centrality of physical position as a cue that leads to systematic biases in people' decisions to retain or eliminate a participant from a group. Termed the "center-stage" effect, we argue that people use their belief that "important people sit in the middle" as a schematic cue that they substitute for individuating performance information for individuals who occupy central positions when the goal is to eliminate all but one of the group members. This leads to the errors of those in center-positions being overlooked: or making them the "centers-of-inattention." Study 1 examines people's lay beliefs regarding positions using two stylized placement tasks (a group interview and classroom seating scenarios). These suggest that people believe that more attention is paid to those in the center than those on the extremes. Study 2 tests the center-stage effect using observational data from a real television show, The Weakest Link. Results show that players assigned at random to central positions are more likely to win the game than those in extreme positions. Study 3, a laboratory experiment manipulating attention paid to the game shows that observers overlook the errors of players in the center to a greater extent than the errors of players in extreme positions. Study 4 replicates the game in the laboratory with direct process measures to show that players playing the game make the same error. Study 5 shows that in a stylized group interview setting, participants who believe that "important people sit in the middle" find the performance of candidates in the extreme position easier to recall than the performance of those in the central position, and are more likely to choose them. Study 6 shows that the "center-stage" effects are weaker when the end-game rule allows for two (vs one) contestants to be retained. Overall results converge to show that the use of the "center-stage" heuristic substitutes for the effortful processing of individuating information, leading to a biased (favorable) assessment of people in the center. Implications for decision-making are discussed. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Humans can select actions by learning, planning, or retrieving motor memories. Reinforcement Learning (RL) associates these processes with three major classes of strategies for action selection: exploratory RL learns state-action values by exploration, model-based RL uses internal models to simulate future states reached by hypothetical actions, and motor-memory RL selects past successful state-action mapping. In order to investigate the neural substrates that implement these strategies, we conducted a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment while humans performed a sequential action selection task under conditions that promoted the use of a specific RL strategy. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex and ventral striatum increased activity in the exploratory condition; the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, dorsomedial striatum, and lateral cerebellum in the model-based condition; and the supplementary motor area, putamen, and anterior cerebellum in the motor-memory condition. These findings suggest that a distinct prefrontal-basal ganglia and cerebellar network implements the model-based RL action selection strategy.},

abstract = {This paper describes how meta-cognitive processes (i.e., the self monitoring and regulating of cognitive processes) may be captured within a cognitive architecture Clarion. Some currently popular cognitive architectures lack sufficiently complex built-in meta-cognitive mechanisms. However, a sufficiently complex meta-cognitive mechanism is important, in that it is an essential part of cognition and without it, human cognition may not function properly. We contend that such a meta-cognitive mechanism should be an integral part of a cognitive architecture. Thus, such a mechanism has been developed within the Clarion cognitive architecture. The paper demonstrates how human data of two meta-cognitive experiments are simulated using Clarion. The simulations show that the meta-cognitive processes represented by the experimental data (and beyond) can be adequately captured within the Clarion framework. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {A network of brain structures including hippocampus (HC), prefrontal cortex, and striatum controls goal-directed behavior and decision making. However, the neural mechanisms underlying these functions are unknown. Here, we review the role of 'internally generated sequences': structured, multi-neuron firing patterns in the network that are not confined to signaling the current state or location of an agent, but are generated on the basis of internal brain dynamics. Neurophysiological studies suggest that such sequences fulfill functions in memory consolidation, augmentation of representations, internal simulation, and recombination of acquired information. Using computational modeling, we propose that internally generated sequences may be productively considered a component of goal-directed decision systems, implementing a sampling-based inference engine that optimizes goal acquisition at multiple timescales of on-line choice, action control, and learning. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Memory-Prediction Framework (MPF) and its Hierarchical-Temporal Memory implementation (HTM) have been widely applied to unsupervised learning problems, for both classification and prediction. To date, there has been no attempt to incorporate MPF/HTM in reinforcement learning or other adaptive systems; that is, to use knowledge embodied within the hierarchy to control a system, or to generate behaviour for an agent. This problem is interesting because the human neocortex is believed to play a vital role in the generation of behaviour, and the MPF is a model of the human neocortex.We propose some simple and biologically-plausible enhancements to the Memory-Prediction Framework. These cause it to explore and interact with an external world, while trying to maximize a continuous, time-varying reward function. All behaviour is generated and controlled within the MPF hierarchy. The hierarchy develops from a random initial configuration by interaction with the world and reinforcement learning only. Among other demonstrations, we show that a 2-node hierarchy can learn to successfully play "rocks, paper, scissors" against a predictable opponent.},

@article{Wang2012,
abstract = {In this review, I briefly summarize current neurobiological studies of decision-making that bear on two general themes. The first focuses on the nature of neural representation and dynamics in a decision circuit. Experimental and computational results suggest that ramping-to-threshold in the temporal domain and trajectory of population activity in the state space represent a duality of perspectives on a decision process. Moreover, a decision circuit can display several different dynamical regimes, such as the ramping mode and the jumping mode with distinct defining properties. The second is concerned with the relationship between biologically-based mechanistic models and normative-type models. A fruitful interplay between experiments and these models at different levels of abstraction have enabled investigators to pose increasingly refined questions and gain new insights into the neural basis of decision-making. In particular, recent work on multi-alternative decisions suggests that deviations from rational models of choice behavior can be explained by established neural mechanisms. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of continual learning [1] in a new way, combining multi-modular reinforcement learning with inspiration from the motor cortex to produce a unique perspective on hierarchical behavior. Most reinforcement-learning agents represent policies monolithically using a single table or function approximator. In those cases where the policies are split among a few different modules, these modules are related to each other only in that they work together to produce the agent's overall policy. In contrast, the brain appears to organize motor behavior in a two-dimensional map, where nearby locations represent similar behaviors. This representation allows the brain to build hierarchies of motor behavior that correspond not to hierarchies of subroutines but to regions of the map such that larger regions correspond to more general behaviors. Inspired by the benefits of the brain's representation, the system presented here is a first step and the first attempt toward the two-dimensional organization of learned policies according to behavioral similarity. We demonstrate a fully autonomous multi-modular system designed for the constant accumulation of ever more sophisticated skills (the continual-learning problem). The system can split up a complex task among a large number of simple modules such that nearby modules correspond to similar policies. The eventual goal is to develop and use the resulting organization hierarchically, accessing behaviors by their location and extent in the map.},

abstract = {Distributed and hierarchical models of control are nowadays popular in computational modeling and robotics. In the artificial neural network literature, complex behaviors can be produced by composing elementary building blocks or motor primitives, possibly organized in a layered structure. However, it is still unknown how the brain learns and encodes multiple motor primitives, and how it rapidly reassembles, sequences and switches them by exerting cognitive control. In this paper we advance a novel proposal, a hierarchical programmable neural network architecture, based on the notion of programmability and an interpreter-programmer computational scheme. In this approach, complex (and novel) behaviors can be acquired by embedding multiple modules (motor primitives) in a single, multi-purpose neural network. This is supported by recent theories of brain functioning in which skilled behaviors can be generated by combining functional different primitives embedded in ‘‘reusable'' areas of ‘‘recycled'' neurons. Such neuronal substrate supports flexible cognitive control, too. Modules are seen as interpreters of behaviors having controlling input parameters, or programs that encode structures of networks to be interpreted. Flexible cognitive control can be exerted by a programmer module feeding the interpreters with appropriate input parameters, without modifying connectivity. Our results in a multiple T-maze robotic scenario show how this computational framework provides a robust, scalable and flexible scheme that can be iterated at different hierarchical layers permitting to learn, encode and control multiple qualitatively different behaviors.},

abstract = {Our empirical, neuroscientific understanding of biological motor systems has been rapidly growing in recent years. However, this understanding has not been systematically mapped to a quantitative characterization of motor control based in control theory. Here, we attempt to bridge this gap by describing the neural optimal control hierarchy (NOCH), which can serve as a foundation for biologically plausible models of neural motor control. The NOCH has been constructed by taking recent control theoretic models of motor control, analyzing the required processes, generating neurally plausible equivalent calculations and mapping them on to the neural structures that have been empirically identified to form the anatomical basis of motor control. We demonstrate the utility of the NOCH by constructing a simple model based on the identified principles and testing it in two ways. First, we perturb specific anatomical elements of the model and compare the resulting motor behavior with clinical data in which the corresponding area of the brain has been damaged. We show that damaging the assigned functions of the basal ganglia and cerebellum can cause the movement deficiencies seen in patients with Huntington's disease and cerebellar lesions. Second, we demonstrate that single spiking neuron data from our model's motor cortical areas explain major features of single-cell responses recorded from the same primate areas. We suggest that together these results show how NOCH-based models can be used to unify a broad range of data relevant to biological motor control in a quantitative, control theoretic framework.},

abstract = {Research on human and animal behavior has long emphasized its hierarchical structure-the divisibility of ongoing behavior into discrete tasks, which are comprised of subtask sequences, which in turn are built of simple actions. The hierarchical structure of behavior has also been of enduring interest within neuroscience, where it has been widely considered to reflect prefrontal cortical functions. In this paper, we reexamine behavioral hierarchy and its neural substrates from the point of view of recent developments in computational reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider a set of approaches known collectively as hierarchical reinforcement learning, which extend the reinforcement learning paradigm by allowing the learning agent to aggregate actions into reusable subroutines or skills. A close look at the components of hierarchical reinforcement learning suggests how they might map onto neural structures, in particular regions within the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex. It also suggests specific ways in which hierarchical reinforcement learning might provide a complement to existing psychological models of hierarchically structured behavior. A particularly important question that hierarchical reinforcement learning brings to the fore is that of how learning identifies new action routines that are likely to provide useful building blocks in solving a wide range of future problems. Here and at many other points, hierarchical reinforcement learning offers an appealing framework for investigating the computational and neural underpinnings of hierarchically structured behavior.},
