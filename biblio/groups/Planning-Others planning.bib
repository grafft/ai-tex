abstract = {This article reviews research in the development of plan generation systems. Our goal is to familiarize the reader with some of the important problems that have arisen in the design of planning systems and to discuss some of the many solutions that have been developed in the over 30 years of research in this area. In this article, we broadly cover the major ideas in the field of AI planning and show the direction in which some current research is going. We define some of the terms commonly used in the planning literature, describe some of the basic issues coming from the design of planning systems, and survey results in the area. Because such tasks are virtually never ending, and thus, any finite document must be incomplete, we provide references to connect each idea to the appropriate literature and allow readers access to the work most relevant to their own research or applications.},

@article{Bai2013,
abstract = {When a robot uses an imperfect system model to plan its actions, a key challenge is the exploration-exploitation trade-off between two sometimes conflicting objectives: (i) learning and improving the model, and (ii) immediate progress towards the goal, according to the current model. To address model uncertainty systematically, we propose to use Bayesian reinforcement learning and cast it as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We present a simple algorithm for offline POMDP planning in the continuous state space. Offline planning produces a POMDP policy, which can be executed efficiently online as a finite-state controller. This approach seamlessly integrates planning and learning: it incorporates learning objectives in the computed plan, which then enables the robot to learn nearly optimally online and reach the goal. We evaluated the approach in simulations on two distinct tasks, acrobot swing-up and autonomous vehicle navigation amidst pedestrians, and obtained interesting preliminary results.},

abstract = {Despite the large body of work in both motion planning and multi-agent simulation, little work has focused on the problem of planning motion for groups of robots using external ¿controller¿ agents. We call this problem the group control problem. This problem is complex because it is highly underactuated, dynamic, and requires multi-agent cooperation. In this paper, we present a variety of new motion planning algorithms based on EST, RRT, and PRM methods for shepherds to guide flocks of robots through obstacle-filled environments. We show using simulation on several environments that under certain circumstances, motion planning can find paths that are too complicated for nai¿ve ¿simulation only¿ approaches. However, inconsistent results indicate that this problem is still in need of additional study.},

Since the human be- havior is unpredictable and ambiguous, an interactive robotic system is to continuously interpret intentions and goals adapting its executive and communicative processes according to the users behaviors. In this work, we propose an integrated system that exploits attentional mechanisms to flexibly adapt planning and executive processes to the multimodal human-robot interaction.},

abstract = {Domain-independent planning is one of the long-standing sub-areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), aiming at approaching human problem-solving flexibility. The area has long had an affinity towards playful illustrative examples, imprinting it on the mind of many a student as an area concerned with the rearrangement of blocks, and with the order in which to put on socks and shoes (not to mention the disposal of bombs in toilets). Working on the assumption that this “student” is you – the readers in earlier stages of their careers – I herein aim to answer three questions that you surely desired to ask back then already:What is it good for? Does it work? Is it interesting to do research in? Answering the latter two questions in the affirmative (of course!), I outline some of the major developments of the last decade, revolutionizing the ability of planning to scale up, and the understanding of the enabling technology. Answering the first question, I point out that modern planning proves to be quite useful for solving practical problems - including, perhaps, yours.},

abstract = {Plan recognition, the problem of inferring the goals or plans of an observed agent, is a key el- ement of situation awareness in human-machine and machine-machine interactions for many appli- cations. Some plan recognition algorithms require knowledge about the potential behaviours of the observed agent in the form of a plan library, to- gether with a decision model about how the ob- served agent uses the plan library to make deci- sions. It is however difficult to elicit and specify the decision model a priori. In this paper, we present a recursive neural network model that learns such a decision model automatically. We discuss promis- ing experimental results of the approach with com- parisons to selected state-of-the-art plan recogni- tion algorithms on three benchmark domains. 1},

@article{Gerevini2009,
abstract = {The international planning competition (IPC) is an important driver for planning research. The general goals of the IPC include pushing the state of the art in planning technology by posing new scientific challenges, encouraging direct comparison of planning systems and techniques, developing and improving a common planning domain definition language, and designing new planning domains and problems for the research community. This paper focuses on the deterministic part of the fifth international planning competition (IPC5), presenting the language and benchmark domains that we developed for the competition, as well as a detailed experimental evaluation of the deterministic planners that entered IPC5, which helps to understand the state of the art in the field. We present an extension of pddl, called pddl3, allowing the user to express strong and soft constraints about the structure of the desired plans, as well as strong and soft problem goals. We discuss the expressive power of the new language focusing on the restricted version that was used in IPC5, for which we give some basic results about its compilability into pddl2. Moreover, we study the relative performance of the IPC5 planners in terms of solved problems, CPU time, and plan quality; we analyse their behaviour with respect to the winners of the previous competition; and we evaluate them in terms of their capability of dealing with soft goals and constraints, and of finding good quality plans in general. Overall, the results indicate significant progress in the field, but they also reveal that some important issues remain open and require further research, such as dealing with strong constraints and computing high quality plans in metric-time domains and domains involving soft goals or constraints. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.},
