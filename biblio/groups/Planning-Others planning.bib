abstract = {This paper describes a collection of optimization algorithms for achieving dynamic planning, control, and state estimation for a bipedal robot designed to operate reliably in complex environments. To make challenging locomotion tasks tractable, we describe several novel applications of convex, mixed-integer, and sparse nonlinear optimization to problems ranging from footstep placement to whole-body planning and control. We also present a state estimator formulation that, when combined with our walking controller, permits highly precise execution of extended walking plans over non-flat terrain. We describe our complete system integration and experiments carried out on Atlas, a full-size hydraulic humanoid robot built by Boston Dynamics, Inc.},

abstract = {Handling multiple conflicting objectives in dynamic job shop scheduling is challenging because many aspects of the problem need to be considered when designing dispatching rules. A multi-objective genetic programming based hyper-heuristic (MO-GPHH) method is investigated here to facilitate the designing task. The goal of this method is to evolve a Pareto front of non-dominated dispatching rules which can be used to support the decision makers by providing them with potential trade-offs among different objectives. The experimental results under dif-ferent shop conditions suggest that the evolved Pareto front contains very effective rules. Some extensive analyses are also presented to help confirm the quality of the evolved rules. The Pareto front obtained can cover a much wider ranges of rules as compared to a large number of dispatching rules reported in the literature. Moreover, it is also shown that the evolved rules are robust across different shop conditions.},

abstract = {Domain-independent planning is one of the long-standing sub-areas of Artificial Intelligence (AI), aiming at approaching human problem-solving flexibility. The area has long had an affinity towards playful illustrative examples, imprinting it on the mind of many a student as an area concerned with the rearrangement of blocks, and with the order in which to put on socks and shoes (not to mention the disposal of bombs in toilets). Working on the assumption that this “student” is you – the readers in earlier stages of their careers – I herein aim to answer three questions that you surely desired to ask back then already:What is it good for? Does it work? Is it interesting to do research in? Answering the latter two questions in the affirmative (of course!), I outline some of the major developments of the last decade, revolutionizing the ability of planning to scale up, and the understanding of the enabling technology. Answering the first question, I point out that modern planning proves to be quite useful for solving practical problems - including, perhaps, yours.},
