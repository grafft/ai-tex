abstract = {Reinforcement learning has been an important category of machine learning approaches exhibiting self-learning and online learning characteristics. Using reinforcement learning, an agent can learn its behaviors through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment and finally come up with an optimal strategy. Reinforcement learning suffers the curse of dimensionality, though there has been significant progress to overcome this issue in recent years. MAXQ is one of the most common approaches for reinforcement learning. To function properly, MAXQ requires a decomposition of the agent's task into a task hierarchy. Previously, the decomposition can only be done manually. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for automatic subtask discovery. The mechanism applies clustering to automatically construct task hierarchy required by MAXQ, such that MAXQ can be fully automated. We present the design of our mechanism, and demonstrate its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and an extensive experimental evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

There already exist feasible solutions for many of these challenges, but they depend upon having rich task models. In this work we detail a novel type of Hierarchical Task Network we call a Clique/Chain HTN (CC-HTN), alongside an algorithm for autonomously constructing them from topological properties derived from graphical task representations. As the presented method relies on the structure of the task itself, our work imposes no particular type of symbolic insight into motor primitives or environmental representation, making it applicable to a wide variety of use cases critical to human-robot interaction. We present evaluations within a multi-resolution goal inference task and a transfer learning application showing the utility of our approach.},

abstract = {We present a novel deep recurrent neural network architecture that learns to build implicit plans in an end-to-end manner by purely interacting with an environment in reinforcement learning setting. The network builds an internal plan, which is continuously updated upon observation of the next input from the environment. It can also partition this internal representation into contiguous sub- sequences by learning for how long the plan can be committed to - i.e. followed without re-planing. Combining these properties, the proposed model, dubbed STRategic Attentive Writer (STRAW) can learn high-level, temporally abstracted macro- actions of varying lengths that are solely learnt from data without any prior information. These macro-actions enable both structured exploration and economic computation. We experimentally demonstrate that STRAW delivers strong improvements on several ATARI games by employing temporally extended planning strategies (e.g. Ms. Pacman and Frostbite). It is at the same time a general algorithm that can be applied on any sequence data. To that end, we also show that when trained on text prediction task, STRAW naturally predicts frequent n-grams (instead of macro-actions), demonstrating the generality of the approach.},

abstract = {Tasks that require many sequential decisions are hard to solve using conventional rein- forcement learning algorithms. Based on the option framework, we propose a model which aims to alleviate these concerns. Instead of learning a single monolithic policy, the agent learns a set of simpler sub-policies as well as the initiation and termination probabili- ties for each of those sub-policies. While ex- isting option learning algorithms frequently require manual specification of components such as the sub-policies, we present an algo- rithm which infers all relevant components of the option framework from data. We present results on SMDPs with discrete as well as continuous state-action spaces. The results show that the presented algorithm can combine simple sub-policies to solve complex tasks and can improve learning performance on simpler tasks.},

The smaller problems are solved separately and the results re-combined to find a solution to the original problem. It is well known that the na{\"{i}}ve application of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques fails to scale to more complex domains. This Chapter introduces hierarchical approaches to reinforcement learning that hold out the promise of reducing a reinforcement learning problems to a manageable size. Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) rests on finding good re-usable temporally extended actions that may also provide opportunities for state abstraction. Methods for reinforcement learning can be extended to work with abstract states and actions over a hierarchy of subtasks that decompose the original problem, potentially reducing its computational complexity. We use a four-room task as a running example to illustrate the various concepts and approaches, including algorithms that can automatically learn the hierarchical structure from interactions with the domain.},

@article{Botvinick2009a,
abstract = {Research on human and animal behavior has long emphasized its hierarchical structure-the divisibility of ongoing behavior into discrete tasks, which are comprised of subtask sequences, which in turn are built of simple actions. The hierarchical structure of behavior has also been of enduring interest within neuroscience, where it has been widely considered to reflect prefrontal cortical functions. In this paper, we reexamine behavioral hierarchy and its neural substrates from the point of view of recent developments in computational reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider a set of approaches known collectively as hierarchical reinforcement learning, which extend the reinforcement learning paradigm by allowing the learning agent to aggregate actions into reusable subroutines or skills. A close look at the components of hierarchical reinforcement learning suggests how they might map onto neural structures, in particular regions within the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex. It also suggests specific ways in which hierarchical reinforcement learning might provide a complement to existing psychological models of hierarchically structured behavior. A particularly important question that hierarchical reinforcement learning brings to the fore is that of how learning identifies new action routines that are likely to provide useful building blocks in solving a wide range of future problems. Here and at many other points, hierarchical reinforcement learning offers an appealing framework for investigating the computational and neural underpinnings of hierarchically structured behavior.},

We apply the framework to the knowledge transfer problem, and show that an agent can learn a portable shaping function from experience in a sequence of tasks to significantly improve performance in a later related task, even given a very brief training period.

abstract = {Learning policies for complex tasks that require multiple different skills is a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). It is also a requirement for its deployment in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient multi-task reinforcement learning. Our framework trains agents to employ hierarchical policies that decide when to use a previously learned policy and when to learn a new skill. This enables agents to continually acquire new skills during different stages of training. Each learned task corresponds to a human language description. Because agents can only access previously learned skills through these descriptions, the agent can always provide a human-interpretable description of its choices. In order to help the agent learn the complex temporal dependencies necessary for the hierarchical policy, we provide it with a stochastic temporal grammar that modulates when to rely on previously learned skills and when to execute new skills. We validate our approach on Minecraft games designed to explicitly test the ability to reuse previously learned skills while simultaneously learning new skills.},

The results of two computational experiments show that optimal primary reward signals may yield both emergent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The evolutionary perspective and the associated optimal reward framework thus lead to the conclusion that there are no hard and fast features distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic reward computationally.

To do this, we compute a bisimulation metric [Ferns et al., 2004] between the states in a small MDP and the states in a large MDP, which we want to solve. The shape of this metric is then used to completely define a set of options for the large MDP. We demonstrate empirically that our approach is able to improve the speed of reinforcement learning, and is generally not sensitive to parameter tuning.},

We define priors on the primitive environment model and on task pseudo-rewards. Since models for composite tasks can be complex, we use a mixed model-based/model-free learning approach to find an optimal hierarchical policy. We show empirically that (i) our approach results in improved convergence over non-Bayesian baselines, (ii) using both task hierarchies and Bayesian priors is better than either alone, (iii) taking advantage of the task hierarchy reduces the computational cost of Bayesian reinforcement learning and (iv) in this framework, task pseudo-rewards can be learned instead of being manually specified, leading to hierarchically optimal rather than recursively optimal policies.},

@article{Rasmussen2017a,
abstract = {We present the first model capable of performing hierarchical reinforcement learning in a general, neurally detailed imple-mentation. We show that this model is able to learn a spatial pickup and delivery task more quickly than one without hier-archical abilities. In addition, we show that this model is able to leverage its hierarchical structure to transfer learned knowl-edge between related tasks. These results point towards the advantages to be gained by using a hierarchical RL framework to understand the brain's powerful learning ability.},

abstract = {We present the Q-Cut algorithm, a graph theoretic approach for automatic detection of sub-goals in a dynamic environment, which is used for acceleration of the Q-Learning algorithm. The learning agent creates an on-line map of the process history, and uses an efficient Max-Flow/Min-Cut algorithm for identifying bottlenecks. The policies for reaching bottlenecks are separately learned and added to the model in a form of options (macro-actions). We then extend the basic Q-Cut algorithm to the Segmented Q-Cut algorithm, which uses previously identified bottlenecks for state space partitioning, necessary for finding additional bottlenecks in complex environments. Experiments show significant performance improvements, particulary in the initial learning phase.},

abstract = {We consider a graph theoretic approach for automatic construction of options in a dynamic environment. A map of the environment is generated on-line by the learning agent, representing the topological structure of the state transitions. A clustering algorithm is then used to partition the state space to different regions. Policies for reaching the different parts of the space are separately learned and added to the model in a form of options (macro-actions). The options are used for accelerating the Q-Learning algorithm. We extend the basic algorithm and consider building a map that includes preliminary indication of the location of "interesting" regions of the state space, where the value gradient is significant and additional exploration might be beneficial. Experiments indicate significant speedups, especially in the initial learning phase.},

abstract = {We describe a framework for building abstraction hierarchies whereby an agent alternates skill- and representation-acquisition phases to construct a sequence of increasingly abstract Markov decision processes. Our formulation builds on recent results showing that the appropriate abstract representation of a problem is specified by the agent's skills. We describe how such a hierarchy can be used for fast planning, and illustrate the construction of an appropriate hierarchy for the Taxi domain.},
