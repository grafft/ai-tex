abstract = {We consider a graph theoretic approach for automatic construction of options in a dynamic environment. A map of the environment is generated on-line by the learning agent, representing the topological structure of the state transitions. A clustering algorithm is then used to partition the state space to different regions. Policies for reaching the different parts of the space are separately learned and added to the model in a form of options (macro-actions). The options are used for accelerating the Q-Learning algorithm. We extend the basic algorithm and consider building a map that includes preliminary indication of the location of "interesting" regions of the state space, where the value gradient is significant and additional exploration might be beneficial. Experiments indicate significant speedups, especially in the initial learning phase.},

@article{Hayes2016b,
abstract = {Collaboration between humans and robots requires solutions to an array of challenging problems, including multi-agent planning, state estimation, and goal inference. There already exist feasible solutions for many of these challenges, but they depend upon having rich task models. In this work we detail a novel type of Hierarchical Task Network we call a Clique/Chain HTN (CC-HTN), alongside an algorithm for autonomously constructing them from topological properties derived from graphical task representations. As the presented method relies on the structure of the task itself, our work imposes no particular type of symbolic insight into motor primitives or environmental representation, making it applicable to a wide variety of use cases critical to human-robot interaction. We present evaluations within a multi-resolution goal inference task and a transfer learning application showing the utility of our approach.},

@article{Daniel2016a,
abstract = {Tasks that require many sequential decisions are hard to solve using conventional rein- forcement learning algorithms. Based on the option framework, we propose a model which aims to alleviate these concerns. Instead of learning a single monolithic policy, the agent learns a set of simpler sub-policies as well as the initiation and termination probabili- ties for each of those sub-policies. While ex- isting option learning algorithms frequently require manual specification of components such as the sub-policies, we present an algo- rithm which infers all relevant components of the option framework from data. We present results on SMDPs with discrete as well as continuous state-action spaces. The results show that the presented algorithm can combine simple sub-policies to solve complex tasks and can improve learning performance on simpler tasks.},

Under appropriate assumptions, HI-MAT induces hierarchies that are consis- tent with the observed trajectory and have compact value-function tables employing safe state abstractions.

The policies for reaching bottlenecks are separately learned and added to the model in a form of options (macro-actions).

abstract = {We describe an approach to incorporating Bayesian priors in the MAXQ framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We define priors on the primitive environment model and on task pseudo-rewards. Since models for composite tasks can be complex, we use a mixed model-based/model-free learning approach to find an optimal hierarchical policy. We show empirically that (i) our approach results in improved convergence over non-Bayesian baselines, (ii) using both task hierarchies and Bayesian priors is better than either alone, (iii) taking advantage of the task hierarchy reduces the computational cost of Bayesian reinforcement learning and (iv) in this framework, task pseudo-rewards can be learned instead of being manually specified, leading to hierarchically optimal rather than recursively optimal policies.},

@article{Wang2012b,
abstract = {Reinforcement learning has been an important category of machine learning approaches exhibiting self-learning and online learning characteristics. Using reinforcement learning, an agent can learn its behaviors through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment and finally come up with an optimal strategy. Reinforcement learning suffers the curse of dimensionality, though there has been significant progress to overcome this issue in recent years. MAXQ is one of the most common approaches for reinforcement learning. To function properly, MAXQ requires a decomposition of the agent's task into a task hierarchy. Previously, the decomposition can only be done manually. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for automatic subtask discovery. The mechanism applies clustering to automatically construct task hierarchy required by MAXQ, such that MAXQ can be fully automated. We present the design of our mechanism, and demonstrate its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and an extensive experimental evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

In this paper we present a mechanism for automatically constructing such actions, expressed as options [Sutton et al., 1999], in a finite Markov Decision Process (MDP). To do this, we compute a bisimulation metric [Ferns et al., 2004] between the states in a small MDP and the states in a large MDP, which we want to solve. The shape of this metric is then used to completely define a set of options for the large MDP. We demonstrate empirically that our approach is able to improve the speed of reinforcement learning, and is generally not sensitive to parameter tuning.},

The framework attempts to capture the notion of tasks that are related but distinct, and provides some insight into when transfer can be usefully applied to a problem sequence and when it cannot. We apply the framework to the knowledge transfer problem, and show that an agent can learn a portable shaping function from experience in a sequence of tasks to significantly improve performance in a later related task, even given a very brief training period. We also apply the framework to skill transfer, to show that agents can learn portable skills across a sequence of tasks that significantly improve performance on later related tasks, approaching the performance of agents given perfectly learned problem-specific skills.},
