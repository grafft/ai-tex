abstract = {Artificial intelligence research has foundered on the issue of representation.$\backslash$nWhen intelligence is approached in an incremental manner, with strict$\backslash$nreliance on interfacing to the real world through perception and$\backslash$naction, reliance on representation disappears. In this paper we outline$\backslash$nour approach to incrementally building complete intelligent Creatures.$\backslash$nThe fundamental decomposition of the intelligent system is not into$\backslash$nindependent information processing units which must interface with$\backslash$neach other via representations. Instead, the intelligent system is$\backslash$n$\backslash$ndecomposed into independent and parallel activity producers which$\backslash$nall interface directly to the world through perception and action,$\backslash$nrather than interface to each other particularly much. The notions$\backslash$nof central and peripheral systems evaporateeverything is both central$\backslash$nand peripheral. Based on these principles we have built a very successful$\backslash$nseries of mobile robots which operate without supervision as Creatures$\backslash$nin standard office environments.},

It is inspired by the properties of the human cognitive map, and is intended to serve both as a model of the human cognitive map and as a method for robot exploration and map-building. This article describes the assumptions and guarantees behind the generality of the SSH across environments and sensorimotor systems. Evidence is given from several partial implementation of the SSH on simulated and physical robots.},

@article{Bengio2013,
abstract = {The success of machine learning algorithms generally depends on data representation, and we hypothesize that this is because different representations can entangle and hide more or less the different explanatory factors of variation behind the data. Although specific domain knowledge can be used to help design representations, learning with generic priors can also be used, and the quest for AI is motivating the design of more powerful representation-learning algorithms implementing such priors. This paper reviews recent work in the area of unsupervised feature learning and deep learning, covering advances in probabilistic models, auto-encoders, manifold learning, and deep networks. This motivates longer-term unanswered questions about the appropriate objectives for learning good representations, for computing representations (i.e., inference), and the geometrical connections between representation learning, density estimation and manifold learning.},

@article{Richardson2006,
abstract = {We propose a simple approach to combining first-order logic and probabilistic graphical models in a single representation. A Markov logic network (MLN) is a first-order knowledge base with a weight attached to each formula (or clause). Together with a set of constants representing objects in the domain, it specifies a ground Markov network containing one feature for each possible grounding of a first-order formula in the KB, with the corresponding weight. Inference in MLNs is performed by MCMC over the minimal subset of the ground network required for answering the query. Weights are efficiently learned from relational databases by iteratively optimizing a pseudo-likelihood measure. Optionally, additional clauses are learned using inductive logic programming techniques. Experiments with a real-world database and knowledge base in a university domain illustrate the promise of this approach.},

This paper examines Sparse Distributed Representations (SDRs), the primary information representation strategy in Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) systems and the neocortex. We derive a number of properties that are core to scaling, robustness, and generalization. We use the theory to provide practical guidelines and illustrate the power of SDRs as the basis of HTM. Our goal is to help create a unified mathematical and practical framework for SDRs as it relates to cortical function.},
