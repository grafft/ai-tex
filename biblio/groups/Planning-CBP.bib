@article{Garrido2016,
abstract = {In this paper we propose myPTutor, a general and effective approach which uses AI planning techniques to create fully tailored learning routes, as sequences of Learning Objects (LOs) that fit the pedagogical and students' requirements. myPTutor has a potential applicability to support e-learning personalization by producing, and automatically solving, a planning model from (and to) e-learning standards in a vast number of real scenarios, from small to medium/large e-learning communities. Our experiments demonstrate that we can solve scenarios with large courses and a high number of students. Therefore, it is perfectly valid for schools, high schools and universities, especially if they already use Moodle, on top of which we have implemented myPTutor. It is also of practical significance for repairing unexpected discrepancies (while the students are executing their learning routes) by using a Case-Based Planning adaptation process that reduces the differences between the original and the new route, thus enhancing the learning process.},

@article{Hammond1990,
abstract = {This article presents a view of planning as a task supported by a dynamic memory. This view attempts to ingegrate models of memory, learning, and planning into a single system that learns about planning by creating new plans and analyzing how they interact with the world. We call this view of planning case-based planning. A case-based planner makes use of its own past experience in developing new plans. It relies on its memory of observed effects, rather than a set of causal rules, to create and modify new plans. Memories of past successes are accessed and modified to create new plans. Memories of past failures are used to warn the planner of impending problems, and memories of past repairs are called upon to tell the planner how to deal with them. This view of planning from experience supports and is supported by a learning system that incorporates new experiences into the planner's episodic memory. This learning algorithm gains from the planner's failures as well as its successes. Successful plans are stored in memory, indexed by the goals they satisfy and the problems they avoid. Failures are also stored and indexed by the features in the world that predict them. By storing failures as well as successes, the planner is able to anticipate and avoid future plan failures. Case-based planning is aimed at improving planning behavior in three areas: failure avoidance, plan repair, and plan reuse. It also attempts gains over current learning systems, in that the learning is driven by the functional needs of a planner. ?? 1990.},

abstract = {We present SET-PR, a novel case-based plan recognition algorithm that is tolerant to missing and misclassified actions in its input action sequences. SET-PR uses a novel representation called action sequence graphs to represent stored plans in its plan library and a similarity metric that uses a combination of graph degree sequences and object similarity to retrieve relevant plans from its library. We evaluated SET-PR by measuring plan recognition convergence and precision with increasing levels of missing and misclassified actions in its input. In our experiments, SET-PR tolerated 20{\%}-30{\%} of input errors without compromising plan recognition performance.},

@article{DeLaRosa2013,
abstract = {Most of the great success of heuristic search as an approach to AI Planning is due to the right design of domain-independent heuristics. Although many heuris- tic planners perform reasonablywell, the computational cost of computing the heuristic function in every search node is very high, causing the planner to scale poorly when increas- ing the size of the planning tasks. For tackling this prob- lem, planners can incorporate additional domain-dependent heuristics in order to improve their performance. Learning- based planners try to automatically acquire these domain- dependent heuristics using previous solved problems. In this work, we present a case-based reasoning approach that learns abstracted state transitions that serve as domain con- trol knowledge for improving the planning process. The rec- ommendations from the retrieved cases are used as guidance for pruning or ordering nodes in different heuristic search al- gorithms applied to planning tasks. We show that the CBR guidance is appropriate for a considerable number of plan- ning benchmarks.},

abstract = {Case-based planning (CBP) is an approach to automated planning that tries to save computational effort by reusing previously found solutions. In 2001, Spalazzi published a survey of work in CBP; here, we present an updated overview of systems that have contributed to the evolution of the field or addressed some issues related to planning by reuse in a novel way. The article presents relevant planners so that readers gain insight into the operation of these systems. This analysis will allow readers to understand the approaches both in the quality of the solutions and in the complexity of finding them.},

@article{Auslander2014a,
abstract = {Executing complex plans for coordinating the behaviors of multiple heterogeneous agents often requires setting several parameters. For example, we are developing a decision aid for deploying a set of autonomous vehicles to perform situation assessment in a disaster relief operation. Our system, the Situated Decision Process (SDP), uses parameterized plans to coordinate these vehicles. However, no model exists for setting the values of these parameters. We describe a case-based reasoning solution for this problem and report on its utility in simulated scenarios, given a case library that represents only a small percentage of the problem space. We found that our agents, when executing plans generated using our case-based algorithm on problems with high uncertainty, performed significantly better than when executing plans using baseline approaches.},
