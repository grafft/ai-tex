abstract = {One way to speed up reinforcement learning is to enable learning to happen simultaneously at multiple resolutions in space and time. This paper shows how to create a Q-learning managerial hierarchy in which high level managers learn how to set tasks to their sub-managers who, in turn, learn how to satisfy them. Sub-managers need not initially understand their managers' commands. They simply learn to maximise their reinforcement in the context of the current command. We illustrate the system using a simple maze task.. As the system learns how to get around, satisfying commands at the multiple levels, it explores more efficiently than standard, flat, Q-learning and builds a more comprehensive map.},

abstract = {Research on human and animal behavior has long emphasized its hierarchical structure-the divisibility of ongoing behavior into discrete tasks, which are comprised of subtask sequences, which in turn are built of simple actions. The hierarchical structure of behavior has also been of enduring interest within neuroscience, where it has been widely considered to reflect prefrontal cortical functions. In this paper, we reexamine behavioral hierarchy and its neural substrates from the point of view of recent developments in computational reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider a set of approaches known collectively as hierarchical reinforcement learning, which extend the reinforcement learning paradigm by allowing the learning agent to aggregate actions into reusable subroutines or skills. A close look at the components of hierarchical reinforcement learning suggests how they might map onto neural structures, in particular regions within the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex. It also suggests specific ways in which hierarchical reinforcement learning might provide a complement to existing psychological models of hierarchically structured behavior. A particularly important question that hierarchical reinforcement learning brings to the fore is that of how learning identifies new action routines that are likely to provide useful building blocks in solving a wide range of future problems. Here and at many other points, hierarchical reinforcement learning offers an appealing framework for investigating the computational and neural underpinnings of hierarchically structured behavior.},

The framework attempts to capture the notion of tasks that are related but distinct, and provides some insight into when transfer can be usefully applied to a problem sequence and when it cannot. We apply the framework to the knowledge transfer problem, and show that an agent can learn a portable shaping function from experience in a sequence of tasks to significantly improve performance in a later related task, even given a very brief training period. We also apply the framework to skill transfer, to show that agents can learn portable skills across a sequence of tasks that significantly improve performance on later related tasks, approaching the performance of agents given perfectly learned problem-specific skills.},

abstract = {Policy search methods can allow robots to learn control policies for a wide range of tasks, but practical applications of policy search often require hand-engineered components for perception, state estimation, and low-level control. In this paper, we aim to answer the following question: does training the perception and control systems jointly end-to-end provide better performance than training each component separately? To this end, we develop a method that can be used to learn policies that map raw image observations directly to torques at the robot's motors. The policies are represented by deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with 92,000 parameters, and are trained using a guided policy search method, which transforms policy search into supervised learning, with supervision provided by a simple trajectory-centric reinforcement learning method. We evaluate our method on a range of real-world manipulation tasks that require close coordination between vision and control, such as screwing a cap onto a bottle, and present simulated comparisons to a range of prior policy search methods.},

Yet, what intrinsic motivation may mean computationally, and how it may differ from extrinsic motivation, remains a murky and controversial subject. In this paper, we adopt an evolutionary perspective and define a new optimal reward framework that captures the pressure to design good primary reward functions that lead to evolutionary success across environments. The results of two computational experiments show that optimal primary reward signals may yield both emergent intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. The evolutionary perspective and the associated optimal reward framework thus lead to the conclusion that there are no hard and fast features distinguishing intrinsic and extrinsic reward computationally. Rather, the directness of the relationship between rewarding behavior and evolutionary success varies along a continuum.},

abstract = {The ability to create and to use abstractions in complex environemnts, that is, to systematically ignore irrelevant details, is a key reason that humans are effective problem solvers. Although the utility of abstraction is commonly accepted, there has been relatively little research on autonomously discovering or creating useful abstractions. A system that can create new abstractions autonomously can learn and plan in situations that its original designer was not able to anticipate. This dissertation introduces two related methods that allow an agent to autonomously discover and create temporal abstractions from its accumulated experience with its environment. A temporal abstraction is an encapsulation of a complex set of actions into a single higher-level action that allows an agent to learn and plan while ignoring details that appear at finer levels of temporal resolution. The main idea of both methods is to search for patterns that occur frequently within an agent's accumulated successful experience and that do not occur in unsuccessful experiences. These patterns are used to create the new temporal abstractions. The two types of temporal abstractions that our methods create are 1) suboals and closed-loop policies for achieving them, and 2) open-loop policies, or action sequences, that are useful "macros." We demonstrate the utility of both types of temporal abstractions in several simulated tasks, including two simulated mobile robot tasks. We use these tasks to demonstrate that the autonomously created temporal abstractions can both facilitate the learning of an agent within a task and can enable effective knowledge transfer related tasks. As a larger task, we focus on the difficult problem of scheduling the assembly instructions for computers with multiple pipelines in such a manner that the reordered instructions will execute as quickly as possible. We demonstrate that the autonomously discovered action sequences can significantly improve performance of the scheduler and can enable effective knowledge transfer across similar processors. Both methods can extract the temporal abstractions from collections of behavioral trajectories generated by different processes. In particular, we demonstrate that the methods can be effective when applied to collections generated by reinforcement learning agents, heuristic searchers, and human tele-operators.},

It is based on the assumption that the programmer can identify useful subgoals and deene subtasks that achieve these subgoals. By deening such subgoals, the programmer constrains the set of policies that need to be considered during reinforcement learning. The MAXQ v alue function decomposition can represent the value function of any policy that is consistent with the given hierarchy. The decomposition also creates oppor-tunities to exploit state abstractions, so that individual MDPs within the hierarchy can ignore large parts of the state space. This is important for the practical application of the method. This paper deenes the MAXQ hierarchy, proves formal results on its representa-tional power, and establishes sve conditions for the safe use of state abstractions. The paper presents an online model-free learning algorithm, MAXQ-Q, and proves that it converges with probability 1 to a kind of locally-optimal policy known as a recursively optimal policy, even in the presence of the eve kinds of state abstraction. The paper evaluates the MAXQ representation and MAXQ-Q through a series of experiments in three domains and shows experimentally that MAXQ-Q with state abstractions converges to a recursively optimal policy much faster than nat Q learning. The fact that MAXQ learns a representation of the value function has an important beneet: it makes it possible to compute and execute an improved, non-hierarchical policy via a procedure similar to the policy improvement step of policy iteration. The paper demonstrates the eeectiveness of this non-hierarchical execution experimentally. Finally, the paper concludes with a comparison to related work and a discussion of the design tradeoos in hierarchical reinforcement learning.},

abstract = {We develop a metalearning approach for learning hierarchically structured policies, improving sample efficiency on unseen tasks through the use of shared primitives---policies that are executed for large numbers of timesteps. Specifically, a set of primitives are shared within a distribution of tasks, and are switched between by task-specific policies. We provide a concrete metric for measuring the strength of such hierarchies, leading to an optimization problem for quickly reaching high reward on unseen tasks. We then present an algorithm to solve this problem end-to-end through the use of any off-the-shelf reinforcement learning method, by repeatedly sampling new tasks and resetting task-specific policies. We successfully discover meaningful motor primitives for the directional movement of four-legged robots, solely by interacting with distributions of mazes. We also demonstrate the transferability of primitives to solve long-timescale sparse-reward obstacle courses, and we enable 3D humanoid robots to robustly walk and crawl with the same policy.},

abstract = {Learning policies for complex tasks that require multiple different skills is a major challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). It is also a requirement for its deployment in real-world scenarios. This paper proposes a novel framework for efficient multi-task reinforcement learning. Our framework trains agents to employ hierarchical policies that decide when to use a previously learned policy and when to learn a new skill. This enables agents to continually acquire new skills during different stages of training. Each learned task corresponds to a human language description. Because agents can only access previously learned skills through these descriptions, the agent can always provide a human-interpretable description of its choices. In order to help the agent learn the complex temporal dependencies necessary for the hierarchical policy, we provide it with a stochastic temporal grammar that modulates when to rely on previously learned skills and when to execute new skills. We validate our approach on Minecraft games designed to explicitly test the ability to reuse previously learned skills while simultaneously learning new skills.},

abstract = {Research on human and animal behavior has long emphasized its hierarchical structure-the divisibility of ongoing behavior into discrete tasks, which are comprised of subtask sequences, which in turn are built of simple actions. The hierarchical structure of behavior has also been of enduring interest within neuroscience, where it has been widely considered to reflect prefrontal cortical functions. In this paper, we reexamine behavioral hierarchy and its neural substrates from the point of view of recent developments in computational reinforcement learning. Specifically, we consider a set of approaches known collectively as hierarchical reinforcement learning, which extend the reinforcement learning paradigm by allowing the learning agent to aggregate actions into reusable subroutines or skills. A close look at the components of hierarchical reinforcement learning suggests how they might map onto neural structures, in particular regions within the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex. It also suggests specific ways in which hierarchical reinforcement learning might provide a complement to existing psychological models of hierarchically structured behavior. A particularly important question that hierarchical reinforcement learning brings to the fore is that of how learning identifies new action routines that are likely to provide useful building blocks in solving a wide range of future problems. Here and at many other points, hierarchical reinforcement learning offers an appealing framework for investigating the computational and neural underpinnings of hierarchically structured behavior.},

Recent attempts to combat the curse of dimensionality have turned to principled ways of exploiting temporal abstraction, where decisions are not required at each step, but rather invoke the execution of temporally-extended activities which follow their own policies until termination. This leads naturally to hierarchical control architectures and associated learning algorithms. We review several approaches to temporal abstraction and hierarchical organization that machine learning researchers have recently developed. Common to these approaches is a reliance on the theory of {\{}semi-Markov{\}} decision processes, which we emphasize in our review. We then discuss extensions of these ideas to concurrent activities, multiagent coordination, and hierarchical memory for addressing partial observability. Concluding remarks address open challenges facing the further development of reinforcement learning in a hierarchical setting.},

abstract = {Growing evidence suggests that the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is organized hierarchically, with more anterior regions having increasingly abstract representations. How does this organization support hierarchical cognitive control and the rapid discovery of abstract action rules? We present computational models at different levels of description. A neural circuit model simulates interacting corticostriatal circuits organized hierarchically. In each circuit, the basal ganglia gate frontal actions, with some striatal units gating the inputs to PFC and others gating the outputs to influence response selection. Learning at all of these levels is accomplished via dopaminergic reward prediction error signals in each corticostriatal circuit. This functionality allows the system to exhibit conditional if-then hypothesis testing and to learn rapidly in environments with hierarchical structure. We also develop a hybrid Bayesian-reinforcement learning mixture of experts (MoE) model, which can estimate the most likely hypothesis state of individual participants based on their observed sequence of choices and rewards. This model yields accurate probabilistic estimates about which hypotheses are attended by manipulating attentional states in the generative neural model and recovering them with the MoE model. This 2-pronged modeling approach leads to multiple quantitative predictions that are tested with functional magnetic resonance imaging in the companion paper.},

abstract = {Reinforcement learning has been an important category of machine learning approaches exhibiting self-learning and online learning characteristics. Using reinforcement learning, an agent can learn its behaviors through trial-and-error interactions with a dynamic environment and finally come up with an optimal strategy. Reinforcement learning suffers the curse of dimensionality, though there has been significant progress to overcome this issue in recent years. MAXQ is one of the most common approaches for reinforcement learning. To function properly, MAXQ requires a decomposition of the agent's task into a task hierarchy. Previously, the decomposition can only be done manually. In this paper, we propose a mechanism for automatic subtask discovery. The mechanism applies clustering to automatically construct task hierarchy required by MAXQ, such that MAXQ can be fully automated. We present the design of our mechanism, and demonstrate its effectiveness through theoretical analysis and an extensive experimental evaluation. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {We present a new subgoal-based method for automatically creating useful skills in reinforcement learning. Our method identifies subgoals by partitioning local state transition graphs—those that are constructed using only the most recent experiences of the agent. The local scope of our subgoal discovery method allows it to successfully identify the type of subgoals we seek—states that lie between two densely-connected regions of the state space—while producing an algorithm with low computational cost.},

@article{Gupta2017,
abstract = {We introduce a neural architecture for navigation in novel environments. Our proposed architecture learns to map from first-person views and plans a sequence of actions towards goals in the environment. The Cognitive Mapper and Planner (CMP) is based on two key ideas: a) a unified joint architecture for mapping and planning, such that the mapping is driven by the needs of the planner, and b) a spatial memory with the ability to plan given an incomplete set of observations about the world. CMP constructs a top-down belief map of the world and applies a differentiable neural net planner to produce the next action at each time step. The accumulated belief of the world enables the agent to track visited regions of the environment. Our experiments demonstrate that CMP outperforms both reactive strategies and standard memory-based architectures and performs well in novel environments. Furthermore, we show that CMP can also achieve semantically specified goals, such as "go to a chair".},

@inproceedings{Alexander2016,
abstract = {We present a novel deep recurrent neural network architecture that learns to build implicit plans in an end-to-end manner by purely interacting with an environment in reinforcement learning setting. The network builds an internal plan, which is continuously updated upon observation of the next input from the environment. It can also partition this internal representation into contiguous sub- sequences by learning for how long the plan can be committed to - i.e. followed without re-planing. Combining these properties, the proposed model, dubbed STRategic Attentive Writer (STRAW) can learn high-level, temporally abstracted macro- actions of varying lengths that are solely learnt from data without any prior information. These macro-actions enable both structured exploration and economic computation. We experimentally demonstrate that STRAW delivers strong improvements on several ATARI games by employing temporally extended planning strategies (e.g. Ms. Pacman and Frostbite). It is at the same time a general algorithm that can be applied on any sequence data. To that end, we also show that when trained on text prediction task, STRAW naturally predicts frequent n-grams (instead of macro-actions), demonstrating the generality of the approach.},

@article{Dietterich1998,
abstract = {This paper presents a new approach to hier- archical reinforcement learning based on the MAXQ decomposition of the value function. The MAXQ decomposition has both a procedu- ral semantics—as a subroutine hierarchy—and a declarative semantics—as a representation of the value function of a hierarchical policy. MAXQ unifies and extends previouswork on hierarchical reinforcement learning by Singh, Kaelbling, and Dayan and Hinton. Conditions under which the MAXQ decomposition can represent the optimal value function are derived. The paper defines a hierarchicalQlearning algorithm, proves its con- vergence, and shows experimentally that it can learn much faster than ordinary “flat” Q learn- ing. Finally, the paper discusses some interest- ing issues that arise in hierarchical reinforcement learning including the hierarchical credit assign- ment problem and non-hierarchical execution of theMAXQ hierarchy.},

We show that this model is able to learn a spatial pickup and delivery task more quickly than one without hier-archical abilities. In addition, we show that this model is able to leverage its hierarchical structure to transfer learned knowl-edge between related tasks. These results point towards the advantages to be gained by using a hierarchical RL framework to understand the brain's powerful learning ability.},

@article{Cao2012,
abstract = {We describe an approach to incorporating Bayesian priors in the MAXQ framework for hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL). We define priors on the primitive environment model and on task pseudo-rewards. Since models for composite tasks can be complex, we use a mixed model-based/model-free learning approach to find an optimal hierarchical policy. We show empirically that (i) our approach results in improved convergence over non-Bayesian baselines, (ii) using both task hierarchies and Bayesian priors is better than either alone, (iii) taking advantage of the task hierarchy reduces the computational cost of Bayesian reinforcement learning and (iv) in this framework, task pseudo-rewards can be learned instead of being manually specified, leading to hierarchically optimal rather than recursively optimal policies.},
