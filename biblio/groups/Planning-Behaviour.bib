abstract = {The ability to perform both causal (means-end) and geometric reasoning is important in order to achieve au- tonomy for advanced robotic systems. In this paper, we describe work in progress on planning for a humanoid two-arm robotic system where task and path planning capabilities have been integrated into a coherent planning framework. We address a number of challenges of integrating combined task and path planning with the complete robotic system, in particular concerning perception and execution. Geometric backtracking is considered: this is the process of revisiting geometric choices (grasps, positions etc.) in previous actions in order to be able to satisfy the geometric preconditions of the action presently under consideration of the planner. We argue that geometric backtracking is required for resolution completeness. Our approach is demon- strated on a real robotic platform, Justin at DLR, and in a simulation of the same robot. In the latter, we consider the consequences of geometric backtracking.},

abstract = {The aim of our research is to build a Reflexive Agent, that is able to either manifest an emotion it is feeling or to hide it. If the Agent decides to manifest its emotion, it can establish what verbal or nonverbal signals to employ communication in its and how to combine and synchronize them. In the decision of whether to express an emotion in a given context, a number of factors are considered, such as the Agent's own personality and goals, the Interlocutor's characteristics and the context. In planning how to communicate an emotion, various factors are considered as well: the available modalities (face, gaze, voice etc); the cognitive ease in producing and processing the various the expressiveness of every signal in communicating specific meanings; and, finally, the appropriateness of signals to social situations.},

abstract = {We describe an integrated strategy for planning, perception, state estimation and action in complex mobile manipulation domains based on planning in the belief space of probability distributions over states using hierarchical goal regression (pre-image back-chaining). We develop a vocabulary of logical expressions that describe sets of belief states, which are goals and subgoals in the planning process. We show that a relatively small set of symbolic operators can give rise to task-oriented perception in support of the manipulation goals. An implementation of this method is demonstrated in simulation and on a real PR2 robot, showing robust, flexible solution of mobile manipulation problems with multiple objects and substantial uncertainty.},

@article{Dehaene1997,
abstract = {Planning a goal-directed sequence of behavior is a higher function of the human brain that relies on the integrity of prefrontal cortical areas. In the Tower of London test, a puzzle in which beads sliding on pegs must be moved to match a designated goal configuration, patients with lesioned prefrontal cortex show deficits in planning a goal-directed sequence of moves. We propose a neuronal network model of sequence planning that passes this test and, when lesioned, fails in a way that mimics prefrontal patients' behavior. Our model comprises a descending planning system with hierarchically organized plan, operation, and gesture levels, and an ascending evaluative system that analyzes the problem and computes internal reward signals that index the correct/erroneous status of the plan. Multiple parallel pathways connecting the evaluative and planning systems amend the plan and adapt it to the current problem. The model illustrates how specialized hierarchically organized neuronal assemblies may collectively emulate central executive or supervisory functions of the human brain.},

@incollection{Matari2008,
abstract = {Nature is filled with examples of autonomous creatures capable of dealing with the diversity, unpredictability, and rapidly changing conditions of the real world. Such creatures must make decisions and take actions based on incomplete perception, time constraints, limited knowledge about the world, cognition, reasoning and physical capabilities, in uncontrolled conditions and with very limited cues about the intent of others. Consequently, one way of evaluating intelligence is based on the creatureʼs ability to make the most of what it has available to handle the complexities of the real world. The main objective of this chapter is to clarify behavior-based systems and their use in single- and multi-robot autonomous control problems and applications. The chapter is organized as follows. Section 38.1 overviews robot control, introducing behavior-based systems in relation to other established approaches to robot control. Section 38.2 follows by outlining the basic principles of behavior-based systems that make them distinct from other types of robot control architectures. The concept of basis behaviors, the means of modularizing behavior-based systems, is presented in Sect. 38.3. Section 38.4 describes how behaviors are used as building blocks for creating representations for use by behavior-based systems, enabling the robot to reason about the world and about itself in that world. Section 38.5 presents several different classes of learning methods for behavior-based systems, validated on single-robot and multi-robot systems. Section 38.6 provides an overview of various robotics problems and application domains that have successfully been addressed with behavior-based control. Finally, Sect. 38.7 concludes the chapter.},

@article{Bai2013,
abstract = {When a robot uses an imperfect system model to plan its actions, a key challenge is the exploration-exploitation trade-off between two sometimes conflicting objectives: (i) learning and improving the model, and (ii) immediate progress towards the goal, according to the current model. To address model uncertainty systematically, we propose to use Bayesian reinforcement learning and cast it as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We present a simple algorithm for offline POMDP planning in the continuous state space. Offline planning produces a POMDP policy, which can be executed efficiently online as a finite-state controller. This approach seamlessly integrates planning and learning: it incorporates learning objectives in the computed plan, which then enables the robot to learn nearly optimally online and reach the goal. We evaluated the approach in simulations on two distinct tasks, acrobot swing-up and autonomous vehicle navigation amidst pedestrians, and obtained interesting preliminary results.},
