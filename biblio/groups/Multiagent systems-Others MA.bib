abstract = {The problem of modeling of the group of pursuers and a running away collective behavior on plane in a perturbed environment has been solved. As objects we assume the unmanned flight vehicles (FVs), which mathematical models are determined by transfer functions that describe the control system with autopilot. Heuristic behavior strategies of all participants of the scene when the speed of running away is higher than the speed of the pursuers are suggested. Situations with different pursuit task solutions' outcomes are modelled in the experimental part of the article.},

abstract = {This paper presents an approach for controlling collision avoidance among a group of moving multi-agents such that they are not able to communicate with each other and hence, cannot share information. The basics and key features of our collision control algorithm are discussed to include practical examinations. Our approach is based on multi-agent systems and help moving agents to pursue their goals using collision free routes. In terms of validating our solution, we plan to apply into a configuration set of agents located in our experimental space. We also explain our solution algorithm that we have developed, along with the examination that we subjected it to, as well as sketching some of the most important challenges that remain to be addresses in our future researches.},

abstract = {As we progress towards a world where robots play an integral role in society, a critical problem that remains to be solved is the pickup team challenge; that is, dynamically formed heterogeneous robot teams executing coordinated tasks where little information is known a priori about the tasks, the robots, and the environments in which they would operate. Successful solutions to forming pickup teams would enable researchers to experiment with larger numbers of robots and enable industry to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate new robot technology with existing legacy teams. In this paper, we define the challenge of pickup teams and propose the treasure hunt domain for evaluating the performance of pickup teams. Additionally, we describe a basic implementation of a pickup team that can search and discover treasure in a previously unknown environment. We build on prior approaches in market-based task allocation and plays for synchronized task execution, to allocate roles amongst robots in the pickup team, and to execute synchronized team actions to accomplish the treasure hunt task},

@article{Gal2010,
abstract = {Computer systems increasingly carry out tasks in mixed networks, that is in group settings in which they interact both with other computer systems and with people. Participants in these heterogeneous human-computer groups vary in their capabilities, goals, and strategies; they may cooperate, collaborate, or compete. The presence of people in mixed networks raises challenges for the design and the evaluation of decision-making strategies for computer agents. This paper describes several new decision-making models that represent, learn and adapt to various social attributes that influence people's decision-making and presents a novel approach to evaluating such models. It identifies a range of social attributes in an open-network setting that influence people's decision-making and thus affect the performance of computer-agent strategies, and establishes the importance of learning and adaptation to the success of such strategies. The settings vary in the capabilities, goals, and strategies that people bring into their interactions. The studies deploy a configurable system called Colored Trails (CT) that generates a family of games. CT is an abstract, conceptually simple but highly versatile game in which players negotiate and exchange resources to enable them to achieve their individual or group goals. It provides a realistic analogue to multi-agent task domains, while not requiring extensive domain modeling. It is less abstract than payoff matrices, and people exhibit less strategic and more helpful behavior in CT than in the identical payoff matrix decision-making context. By not requiring extensive domain modeling, CT enables agent researchers to focus their attention on strategy design, and it provides an environment in which the influence of social factors can be better isolated and studied. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},
